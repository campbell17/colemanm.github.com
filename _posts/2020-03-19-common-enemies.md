Morgan Housel draws similarities between the current crisis and global response to World War II:

> Pandemics kill people and recessions ruin people. Saying they have silver linings is a step too far.
>
> But I wonder if the best map we have that tells us what to expect next is the kind of extreme cooperation, solidarity, and empathy we last saw in the 1940s.
>
> And I wonder if weâ€™ll look back at COVID-19 as one of the worst things to happen to us, yet triggering something positive that couldnâ€™t be achieved any other way.
