Mike Bostock published this cool Observable notebook that generates snapshots showing road networks of centrally-planned cities. Brasilia as an example:

{% include image.html file="observable-brasilia.jpg" description="Brasilia roads" caption="no" %}

It uses a combo of D3 and OpenStreetMap data to generate vector tiles.
