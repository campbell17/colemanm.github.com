A few months back we joined a bowling league here in St. Pete. Our four-person crew consists of me, Colette, Zac, and Cookie. We're now in our second season playing with the same set of teams. It's fun and as far as other organized recreational sports we've played, it's more relaxing and consistent. Soccer certainly was a lot more intense and sometimes less fun.

We're now nearing the end of a second season. I've been tracking my scores on each game, each week. There are three games per session. I feel like I'm getting a bit more comfortable and consisent, but let's investigate the trends.
