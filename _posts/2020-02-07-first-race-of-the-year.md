I just committed to my first race of the year, a 10K in the [St. Pete Distance Classic](http://stpetersburgdistanceclassic.com/ "St. Pete Distance Classic"). Sort of a seat-of-the-pants commitment, but should be able to do a competitive personal time (maybe a PR if I feel good enough). I [promised](/post/2020-goals/ "2020 Goals") to do more races this year, so gotta stick to the plan.

The weather's cooled down for the weekend, and a 6:30am start time should make it comfortable for a speedy run.
