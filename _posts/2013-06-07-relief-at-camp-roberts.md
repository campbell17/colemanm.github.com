A few weeks back, I had the opportunity to go out to Camp Roberts for [RELIEF](http://camproberts.org/), an event in a series of field experiments run several times a year by a conglomeration of government, academic, and industry folks. The objective is to take engineers and early- to mid-stage technology and software, and bring components together in an experimental environment, to test interoperability between technologies in a testbed environment. The typical government procurement process has been historically bad at acquiring suites of tools that have been truly tested to work together. RELIEF is a program to help overturn that.

[Camp Roberts](http://www.calguard.ca.gov/CpRbts/Pages/default.aspx) is just north of Paso Robles, a small town in rural SoCal known for its wineries. It's a California National Guard base, and the RELIEF experiments are staged out at McMillan Airfield, on the south side of the Camp.
