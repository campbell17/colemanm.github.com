Here are the slides from my talk at the first ever [Ignite Tampa Bay](http://ignitetampa.org). It was a blast to watch all the great talks from such a varied set of interests and passions. Great turnout, too &mdash; we drew a sellout crowd out to watch.

As difficult as it is to prepare for [Ignite](http://ignite.oreilly.com/) (20 slides, 15 seconds each, autoadvancing), I would do it again in a heartbeat. I've essentially done _zero_ public speaking, so it's nerve-wracking for me to stand up in front of 100+ people and talk at all &mdash; but it's something I've always wanted to get better at, so I just jumped in. Now that it's all over, I'm glad I did. So when the videos are edited and live, I'll post that, too.

Thanks to all the organizers and presenters for a smashing first Ignite!
