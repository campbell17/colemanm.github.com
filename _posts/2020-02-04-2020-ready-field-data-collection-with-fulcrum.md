Today we hosted a webinar in conjunction with our friends at [NetHope](https://nethope.org/ "NetHope") and [Team Rubicon](https://teamrubiconusa.org/ "Team Rubicon") to give an overview of Fulcrum and what we're collectively doing in disaster relief exercises.

Both organizations deployed to support recent disaster events for [Cyclone Idai](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/team-rubicon-mozambique/ "Team Rubicon Leverages Fulcrum in Cyclone Idai Response") and [Hurricane Dorian](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/field-data-collection-with-fulcrum-mapbox-and-nethope/ "Field Data Collection with Fulcrum, NetHope, and Mapbox") (the Bahamas) and used Fulcrum as a critical piece of their workflow.

Always enjoyable to get to show more about what we're doing to support impactful efforts like this.
