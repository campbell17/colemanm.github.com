A while back I started a text file for logging the best quotes I run across. I [put up a page](/quotes/ "Quotes") to document those here publicly. No sense in keeping good stuff to myself when I can share my favorites.

A few highlights:

_"It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows."_

— [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus "Epictetus")

_"The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design."_

— [F.A. Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek "Friedrich Hayek")

_"Argue as though you are right, but listen as though you are wrong."_

— [Karl Weick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_E%2E_Weick "Karl Weick")

I’ve been periodically adding new ones from my readings. Now that I have better systems for recording them as I encounter them, I’ll start building up the archive.
