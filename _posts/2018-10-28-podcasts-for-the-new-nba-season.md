The NBA season spun up a couple of weeks ago. With that, NBA Twitter and the NBA podcast scene is back in full force. Here are the feeds I try to keep up with:

* [Ringer NBA Show](https://www.theringer.com/the-nba-show)
* [NBA Desktop](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiI3wRw9PbSbC6pcN0gPuDkLzr-k-B8YS)
* [The Lowe Post](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/podcast/archive/_/id/10528553)
* [The Woj Pod](https://art19.com/shows/thewojpod)

The Ringer NBA Show is every weekday with a rotating cast of hosts, so you can always count on deep dives of nearly every game. And NBA Desktop is a must-watch each week. Hilarious.
