Last night we watched Sam Mendes's _[1917](https://letterboxd.com/film/1917/ "1917")_, his latest, a war film set during that year during the First World War. The entire thing is shot to look like a single take following two soldiers attempting to deliver a message to another battalion across no man's land. It's the most gripping film I've seen since _Dunkirk_ (one of my all-time favorites).

This mini-documentary shows some behind the scenes of how they shot the long takes that they stitched together for the final result.
