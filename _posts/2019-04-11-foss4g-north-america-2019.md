Next week Joe and I will be out in San Diego for [FOSS4G-NA 2019](https://2019.foss4g-na.org/). This'll be my first one since I think 2012. There's always an excellent turnout and strong base of good folks to catch up with. This year they've put together a B2B and Government Theme day to kick it off, which to my knowledge is a new thing for an event typically focused on the eponymous free, open source, and community-driven projects.

I thumbed through the agenda to pick out some topics I'm interested in catching this year:

* Open source for utilities and telecom
* OpenStreetMap and WikiData
* Open source in higher education
* [PDAL](https://pdal.io/ "PDAL")
* [OpenDroneMap](https://www.opendronemap.org/ "OpenDroneMap")
* "[Digital twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin "Digital twin")" technology for infrastructure
