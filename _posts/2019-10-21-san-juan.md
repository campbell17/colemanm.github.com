We’re in San Juan this week for the [NetHope Global Summit](https://www.nethopeglobalsummit.org/ "NetHope Global Summit"). Through our partnership with NetHope, a non-profit devoted to bringing technology to disaster relief and humanitarian projects, we’re [hosting a hands-on workshop](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/data-collection-workshop-at-the-nethope-global-summit/ "Data Collection Workshop") on Fulcrum on Thursday.

We’ve already connected with several of the other tech companies in NetHope’s network — Okta, Box, Twilio, and others — leading to some interesting conversations on working together more closely on integrated deployments for humanitarian work.

Looking forward to an exciting week, and maybe some exploring of Old San Juan. Took a walk last night out to dinner along the north shore overlooking the Atlantic.
