  title: "Learn Git Concepts, Not Commands"
---

This guide is a great example of how a lot of introductory walkthroughs of technology should work. Every time I've worked with new users to help them understand using the command line, Unix commands, or git, people only mimic the individual commands they're supposed to type without a fundamental understanding of what's happening.

This’ll now be the first place I send anyone new to git. I know this would’ve helped me a ton in wrapping my mind around how it all worked, and I already had some familiarity with the SVN “trunk” versus “branch” structure.
