### ⚾️ [How Many Outs? Baseball Graphics Compared](https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/10/how-many-outs-baseball-playoff-graphics-compared/ "Baseball Graphics Compared")

Some top-notch baseball geekery, with Jason Snell comparing the graphics overlays from Fox, MLB Network, and ESPN’s telecasts. I’ve thought about this, too, but have to give it to the ESPN one, with Fox right up there.

### 🧘🏽‍♀️ [Book Review: The Mind Illuminated](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/28/book-review-the-mind-illuminated/ "Book Review: The Mind Illuminated")

Scott Alexander’s review is an excellent in-depth look at this book on meditation. I’m still making my way through it, but it’s definitely a fantastic soup-to-nuts guide so far.

### 🇬🇧 [The Crucial Century](https://www.antonhowes.com/blog/the-crucial-century "The Crucial Century")

From an objective observer in the 16th century, what site would have been the best bet to predict the flowering of the Industrial Revolution, based on contemporaneous evidence?

> In fact, England in 1550 was not even close to being Europe’s preeminent naval power. It was Hispania, not Britannia, who ruled the waves. Even on maps made in England and for the use of the English government, the ocean off the west coast of England and to the south of Ireland was labelled The Spanish Sea. The foreign maps agreed. The North Sea, too, was the Oceanus Germanicus, or German Sea. It gives an idea of who controlled what. And England of course came close to catastrophe in 1588, when the Spanish decided to launch an invasion – it was largely only stopped by the weather. Despite having always been on an island, English policymakers only seriously began to appreciate Britain’s geographical potential for both defence and commerce in the late sixteenth century.

It took until the mid-17th century for promise to start taking hold in England. By then it's growth and expansion had begun overtaking its neighbors.
