Nathan Lucy diagrammed Sven Fechner's [great guide](http://simplicitybliss.com/post/126031901202/a-fresh-take-on-contexts) on rethinking GTD contexts: remapping items on a to-do list with a framework of time vs. energy instead of physical limitations. There are few hard borders anymore between physical contexts. Most of my tasks I can do anywhere.

I know this has helped me make better use of OmniFocus contexts, a feature I've essentially never used because of this problem. There's also a video of Sven's talk included, in which he explains the approach.
