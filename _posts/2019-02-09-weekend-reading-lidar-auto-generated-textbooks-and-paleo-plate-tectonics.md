### üõ£ [Creating Low-Cost LiDAR](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/the-ars-technica-guide-to-the-lidar-industry/ "Creating Low-Cost LiDAR")

This is a great breakdown of the different elements of LiDAR technology, looking at three broad areas: beam direction, distance measurement, and frequencies. They compare the tech of 10 different companies in the space to see how each is approaching the problem.

### üìö [An Algorithm to Auto-Generate Textbooks](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612726/this-algorithm-browses-wikipedia-to-auto-generate-textbooks/ "An Algorithm to Auto-Generate Textbooks from Wikipedia")

Taking off of the [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page "Wikibooks") project, this team is aiming to generate books from Wikipedia content using ML techniques.

> Given the advances in artificial intelligence in recent years, is there a way to automatically edit Wikipedia content so as to create a coherent whole that is useful as a textbook? Enter Shahar Admati and colleagues at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel. These guys have developed a way to automatically generate Wikibooks using machine learning. They call their machine the Wikibook-bot. ‚ÄúThe novelty of our technique is that it is aimed at generating an entire Wikibook, without human involvement,‚Äù they say.

### üåç [Paleogeographic History of Plate Tectonics](https://apl.esri.com/jg/PaleoMap/index.html "Paleogeographic Plate Tectonics")

This simple app lets you slide from the Jurassic to the Holocene. A vivid demonstration of how long 200 million years really is.
