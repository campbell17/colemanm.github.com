Our friends over at the [American Geographical Society](https://twitter.com/AmericanGeo "AmericanGeo") have spearheaded a new competition (in partnership with the [Omidyar Network](https://twitter.com/OmidyarNetwork "Omidyar Network")) called [EthicalGEO](https://ethicalgeo.org/ "EthicalGEO") to seek out new ideas on how the community can better understand the ethical challenges with geospatial data, privacy, sharing, and the like, and find solutions and systems to embrace whatâ€™s new and combat the risks and downsides:

> The EthicalGEO initiative seeks to activate thinkers, innovators, entrepreneurs, policymakers, practitioners, students, and everyday citizens and bring them in to a global dialog that shines a light on their best ideas about the ethical challenges and opportunities posed by the many geospatial technologies and data sources that are reshaping our society. Just as the EthicalAI dialog has enabled a broad-based discussion about the future implications of AI, and the ways in which our society might steer the technology to our purposes, the EthicalGEO initiative seeks to spur a similar conversation around the flurry of geospatial innovations that have become part of our daily lives.
