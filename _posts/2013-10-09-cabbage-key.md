I spent last weekend with the family at Cabbage Key, an island near Charlotte Harbor, in southwest Florida. It's only visitable by boat, so we launched the Shamrock on Friday morning to head over the the cottage, including a number of cargo trips to bring all the weekend's people and provisions.

We had a fantastic time fishing, sailing, drinking beers, and eating. Cabbage is a great spot that's close enough to drive to, yet still detached enough to feel like a true vacation away from home.

On Saturday we visited a friend's rustic cabin on [Cayo Costa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayo_Costa_State_Park), a barrier island state park, with a mangrove-lined shore on Pine Island Sound, and a beach on the Gulf. Since, like Cabbage, Cayo Costa is only accessible by private boat or ferry, it's pretty secluded. Our family friend's cabin is a minimalist setup, with just enough shelter, a generator, and small kitchen &mdash; perfect for our weekend seafood grill session.

I recorded some GPS traces of a few of our outings, a couple on the Shamrock, and some on Nat's [Buccaneer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/colemanm/8045621303).
