[Wesley Yang](https://twitter.com/wesyang "Wesley Yang") on the potential staying power of Andrew Yang.

The campaign that Yang is running and the response so far to his candidacy is pleasantly surprising. In a political scene where everything is dire, negative, and "us-versus-them," he brings a levity and sanity to the discourse. Even though I disagree with a lot of his proposed solution, I don't disagree on the diagnosis. It's a relief to see someone in mainstream politics making a dent on a platform of rationalism and open-mindedness.
