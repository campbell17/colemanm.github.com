Tom Critchlow proposes an open format to create a decentralized, open web version of what Goodreads does — a book social network.

> Thinking through building some kind of “web of books” I realized that we could use something similar to RSS to build a kind of decentralized GoodReads powered by indie sites and an underlying easy to parse format.

> I created a proof of concept by converting my own bookshelf into a JSON file https://tomcritchlow.com/library.json.

I made some changes [a while back](/post/books-and-microdata/ "Books and Microdata") to move in this direction with [schema.org](https://schema.org/ "schema.org") structured tags. This moves that idea in a more workable direction, I think.
