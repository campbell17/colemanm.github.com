I just ran across this YouTube channel called [Primitive Technology](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA), created by an Australian from the North Queensland bush country who attempts to recreate building things with Stone Age technology. He makes his own charcoal, fires clay hardware, makes tools, and supplies himself with mud, clay, wood, and everything else right out of the local environment.

Each one is silent with the work speaking for itself. Turn on captions to see embedded explainers talking about what he's doing. An easy YouTube rabbit hole.
