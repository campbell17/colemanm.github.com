### 🏃🏻‍♂️ [Everything You Need to Know About Rhythmic Breathing](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a28413381/rhythmic-breathing/ "Everything You Need to Know About Rhythmic Breathing")

I tried this out the other night on a run. The technique makes some intiutive sense that it'd reduce impact (or level it out side to side anyway). Surely to notice any result you'd have to do it over distance consistently. But I've had some right knee soreness that I don't totally know the origin of, so thought I'd start trying this out. I found it takes a lot of concentration to keep it up consistently. I'll keep testing it out.

### 🏞 [Terrestrial Warfare, Drowned Lands](http://www.bldgblog.com/2019/07/terrestrial-warfare-drowned-lands/ "Terrestrial Warfare, Drowned Lands")

A neat historical, geographical story from BLDGBLOG:

> Briefly, anyone interested in liminal landscapes should find Snell’s description of the Drowned Lands, prior to their drainage, fascinating. The Wallkill itself had no real path or bed, Snell explains, the meadows it flowed through were naturally dammed at one end by glacial boulders from the Ice Age, the whole place was clogged with “rank vegetation,” malarial pestilence, and tens of thousands of eels, and, what’s more, during flood season “the entire valley from Denton to Hamburg became a lake from eight to twenty feet deep.”

Turns out there was local disagreement on flood control:

> A half-century of “war” broke out among local supporters of the dams and their foes: “The dam-builders were called the ‘beavers’; the dam destroyers were known as ‘muskrats.’ The muskrat and beaver war was carried on for years,” with skirmishes always breaking out over new attempts to dam the floods.
>
> Here’s one example, like a scene written by Victor Hugo transplanted to New York State: “A hundred farmers, on the 20th of August, 1869, marched upon the dam to destroy it. A large force of armed men guarded the dam. The farmers routed them and began the work of destruction. The ‘beavers’ then had recourse to the law; warrants were issued for the arrest of the farmers. A number of their leaders were arrested, but not before the offending dam had been demolished. The owner of the dam began to rebuild it; the farmers applied for an injunction. Judge Barnard granted it, and cited the owner of the dam to appear and show cause why the injunction should not be made perpetual. Pending a final hearing, high water came and carried away all vestige of the dam.”

### 🔐 [Fulcrum SAML SSO with Azure and Okta](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/saml-single-sign-on-with-azure-and-okta/ "Fulcrum SAML SSO with Azure and Okta")

This is something we launched a few months back. There's nothing terribly exciting about building SSO features in a SaaS product — it's table stakes to move up in the world with customers. But for me personally it's a signal of success. Back in 2011, imagining that we'd ever have customers large enough to need SAML seemed so far in the future. Now we're there and rolling it out for enterprise customers.
