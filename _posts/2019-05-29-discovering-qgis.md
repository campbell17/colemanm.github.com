This week we've had [Kurt Menke](https://twitter.com/geomenke "Kurt Menke on Twitter") in the office (of [Bird's Eye View GIS](https://www.birdseyeviewgis.com/ "Bird's Eye View GIS")) providing a guided training workshop for QGIS, the canonical open source GIS suite.

It's been a great first two days covering a wide range of topics from his book titled _[Discovering QGIS 3](http://locatepress.com/dq3 "Discovering QGIS")_.

The team attending the workshop is a diverse group with varied backgrounds. Most are GIS professionals using this as a means to get a comprehensive overview of the basics of "what's in the box" on QGIS. All of the GIS folks have the requisite background using Esri tools throughout their training, but some of us that have been playing in the FOSS4G space for longer have been exposed to and used QGIS for years for getting work done. We've also got a half dozen folks in the session from our dev team that know their way around Ruby and Python, but don't have any formal GIS training in their background. This is a great way to get folks exposure to the core principles and technology in the GIS professional's toolkit.

Kurt's course is an excellent overview that covers the ins and outs of using QGIS for geoprocessing and analysis, and touches on lots of the essentials of GIS (the discipline) and along the way. All of your basics are in there â€” clips / unions / intersects and other geoprocesses, data management, editing, attribute calculations (with some advanced expression-based stuff), joins and relates, and a deep dive on all of the powerful symbology and labeling engines built into QGIS these days[^northroad].

The last segment of the workshop is going to cover movement data with the Time Manager extension and some other visualization techniques.

[^northroad]: Hat tip to Niall Dawson of [North Road Geographics](https://north-road.com/ "North Road Geo") (as well as the rest of the contributor community) for all of the amazing development that's gone into the 3.x release of QGIS!
