I just found [this spot](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Baku,+Azerbaijan&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=59.50923,115.048828&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Baku,+Azerbaijan&amp;ll=40.293733,49.923162&amp;spn=0.028445,0.056176&amp;t=h&amp;z=15) off the coast of Baku, Azerbaijan.

The island is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nargin_%28island%29">Nargin</a>, and was a former Soviet military installation. You can see the abandoned base facilities and rusting, derelict hulks of ships on the Caspian beach.
