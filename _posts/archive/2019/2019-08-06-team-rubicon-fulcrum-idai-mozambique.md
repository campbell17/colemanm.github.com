  title: "Team Rubicon Leverages Fulcrum in Cyclone Idai Response"
---

This is the kind of stuff that gets you out of bed in the morning and really gets the motivators up to do things like [Fulcrum Community](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/community/ "Fulcrum Community") to support disaster relief efforts.

When Cyclones [Idai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Idai "Cyclone Idai") and [Kenneth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Kenneth "Cyclone Kenneth") steamrolled into East Africa beginning in March, the crew from [Team Rubicon](https://teamrubiconusa.org/ "Team Rubicon") was deployed to help with EMT response and recovery in Beira and Matarara, Mozambique. They used Fulcrum to record patient data after prior experience with another partner of ours, [NetHope](https://nethope.org/ "NetHope"):

> Earlier in 2019, Team Rubicon deployed with NetHope to install wireless access points on the Colombia/Venezuela border to provide Venezuelan refugees with access to news information and offers of assistance. NetHope utilized Fulcrum to track access-point install requests as well as record successful installs. Team Rubicon received training on Fulcrum during the deployment and grew to like the offline form entry capability, ability to change forms on the fly, and manipulate and analyze the collected information via the console. When faced with the need to collect medical information in an internet-disconnected environment and transmit reports later when within range of internet, Team Rubicon reached out to Fulcrum for support. Fulcrum provided a community disaster grant to facilitate Team Rubiconâ€™s Cyclone Idai response, including developer assistance to rapidly publish medical forms.

Fulcrum did exactly what we designed it for, providing a robust data platform in an austere, low-comms environment easy for field EMTs to use:

> Fulcrum allowed Team Rubicon to quickly enter patient data as well as the multi-sector needs assessment data in a completely disconnected environment. And since the Fulcrum app works on a cellular phone, there was no longer a need to pack bulky and heavy paper forms. Once back at base camp, and with access to internet, Team Rubicon could transmit the daily collected information to its National Operations Center so they could generate the EMT/CC daily reports in the format the EMT/CC preferred.

We're already looking at other ways we can help the amazing folks from Team Rubicon on future missions with data, reporting, and impact analysis.
