  title: "Imaging the Earth, Every Day"

Most people don't know how earth imaging satellites work. All they know is a camera is flying overhead snapping photos. [This visualization](https://nbremer.github.io/planet-globe/ "Planet Globe") gives you an animated picture of how Planet's satellite constellation can cover the entire globe every day for a continuously-updated view of the Earth:

> In four years, Planet has flown on 18 successful launches and deployed 293 satellites successfully into low Earth orbit. With more than 150 satellites currently in orbit, Planet has the largest constellation of Earth imaging satellites in history.

Amazing that we've got this kind of capability with microsatellite technology. Right now most of the sensors (the "Doves") give 3m resolution, but this'll just keep getting better.
