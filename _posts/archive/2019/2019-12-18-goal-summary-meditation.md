First up on the year in review is the meditation practice. I started out doing short meditation sessions sort of randomly late last year. I'd only remember to do it occasionally, maybe a couple times a week. While that's better than zero, it never became a habit or a thing that I would think about consistently. Not to mention that meditation itself is a skill you need to hone over time with experience to get the benefits out of it. Committed practice is the only way it feels useful. This year I set a target to do some meditation each day.

Like many healthy habits, I found it challenging to build up a pattern to reliably sit down for the 10 minutes a day I was targeting. It took months before it felt "normal" to do, even just with the short sessions I was doing.

People say it takes a lot of practice before you can focus with intensity and not have mind-wandering and discomfort immediately, which is absolutely true. If you've never sat down, say with a guided meditation app, and tried to do 15 minutes of mindfulness, it's an interesting experience to be conscious of _just how much_ your mind tends to race all over the place continuously.

Even after a full year of every day practice, I'd still say I don't feel massively "better" at the skill than in January. I don't get as uncomfortable as quickly now as I did then, which is good since that's one of the hardest things to get used to. But I still often feel like I'm fighting even trivial things running around in my head.

I'm glad I could power through and stick with it, but I think my relatively light progress in skill overall is mostly attributable to a high quantity of short sessions. My plan for next year will be raising the per-practice length, but possibly going to only 2 or 3 times per week — perhaps a minimum of 30 minutes each. I'll think some more about that before setting out into 2020.
