Bryan wrote this up about the latest major release of Fulcrum, which added Views to the Editor tool. This is a cool feature that allows users doing QA and data analysis to save sets of columns and filters, akin to how [views](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/sql-createview.html "Postgres Views") work in databases like PostgreSQL. We have some plans next to let users share or publish Views, and also to expose them via our [Query API](https://learn.fulcrumapp.com/dev/query/intro "Query API"), with the underlying data functioning just like a database view does.

Thisâ€™ll be a foundational feature for a lot of upcoming neat stuff.
