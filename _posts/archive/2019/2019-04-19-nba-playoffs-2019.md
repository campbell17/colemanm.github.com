This post is a bit late since the playoffs started last Sunday. This is the best time of year for sports where you’ve got the NBA in the postseason, MLB in full swing, Stanley Cup, PGA majors, and the final stretches of the Premier League and Champions League. So much to watch.

The NBA is especially dense for me, as a fan with no team allegiance. I try to watch as much as I can. But in these first couple rounds there are far too many games to catch all of. Must-watch series for me in round 1:

* OKC / Blazers
* Rockets / Jazz
* Sixers / Nets
* Bucks / Pistons

If it goes the way it looks like it will, there’ll be a 2018 Western Conference Final rematch in round 2. 

Round 2 is shaping up to have some great matchups. As I type this I’m watching Portland and OKC in game three in Oklahoma. Competitive in the third quarter with Damian Lillard (possibly my favorite NBA player) heating up.
