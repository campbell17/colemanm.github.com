### 🗺 [How We Get Data Collected in the Field Ready for Use](https://blog.spatialnetworks.com/at-spatial-networks-data-collection-is-baked-into-our-identity-a8955a9693b)

My colleagues Bill Dollins and Todd Pollard (the core of our data team), wrote this post detailing how we go from original ground-based data collection in Fulcrum through a data processing pipeline to deliver product to customers. A combination of PostGIS, Python tools, FME, Amazon RDS, and other custom QA tools get us from raw content to finished, analyst-ready GEOINT products.

### 🔥 [Mapping the Camp Fire with Drones](https://enterprise.dji.com/news/detail/mapping-camp-fire-with-drones)

> The 518 coordinated flights operation, by 16 Northern California emergency responder agencies, is one of the biggest drone response to a disaster scene in the nation’s history. The 16 UAV teams were led by Alameda County Sheriff's Office. Stockton Police, Contra Cost County Sheriff's Office & Menlo Park Fire Protection District had the most team members present, with Union City Police, Hayward Police and Stanislaus County Sheriff's Office providing units as well. San Francisco Police oversaw airspace mitigation. In addition to the mapping flights, over 160 full 360-degrees and interactive panoramas were created with the help of Hangar, as well as geo-referenced video was shot along major roads in Paradise through Survae.

An impressive effort by response agencies in California to respond to this tragic disaster and assess the damage.

An article on the [Great Unconformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Unconformity) in the geologic record and its potential cause:

> The Grand Canyon is a gigantic geological library, with rocky layers that tell much of the story of Earth’s history. Curiously though, a sizeable layer representing anywhere from 250 million years to 1.2 billion years is missing.

The likely culprit was a theoretical planetwide glaciated period known as the "[Snowball Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth)".
