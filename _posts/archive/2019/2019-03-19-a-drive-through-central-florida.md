We just got back this evening from a long weekend trip up to Jacksonville for medical follow-up and to visit with friends. It's about a 4 hour drive from St. Pete, and I usually do a route that takes us up I-75 to around Ocala, then connect up to I-10 up [US-301](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_301_in_Florida "US 301"). Then the same route home in reverse.

The trip down 301 takes you through a half dozen tiny to small towns that are quintessential "Old Florida"[^fltowns]. On this drive down I thought I'd briefly document each of them with a photolog of sorts, for anyone unfamiliar with what rural Central Florida looks like.

In order from north to south as you connect between the interstates, you pass through:

* Lawtey
* Starke
* Waldo
* Orange Heights
* Hawthorne
* Citra

As you can tell, these are some small places. It's always a reality check to see how relatively sparsely populated so much of the state is, and how different it is living even a couple hours from a major city.

[^fltowns]: A few of them are also notorious as speed traps, with speed limits dropping from 65 to 35 over a quarter mile through them.
