### üõ∞ [Buildings from Imagery with RoboSat](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/daniel-j-h/diary/44321 "Building Extraction from Imagery with RoboSat")

This excellent guide shows how to combine take imagery from OpenAerialMap and buildings from OpenStreetMap, and combine to train a model for automated feature extraction. It uses an open source tool from Mapbox called [RoboSat](https://github.com/mapbox/robosat "RoboSat") combined to compare a GeoTIFF from OAM with a PBF extracts from OSM. Very cool to have a generalized tool for doing this with open data.

### üîê [The State of Software Security in 2019](https://noncombatant.org/2019/01/06/state-of-security-2019/ "State of Security 2019")

An excellent roundup (with tons of ancillary linked sources) on the state of various parts of computer security, from programming, to browsers, to social engineering.

### üåç [The Equal Earth Map](http://www.equal-earth.com/ "Equal Earth Map")

From [Tom Patterson](https://twitter.com/mtnmapper "Tom Patterson Twitter"), the Equal Earth map uses the [equal earth projection](http://www.equal-earth.com/equal-earth-projection.html "Equal Earth Projection") to show countries with their true relative sizes. No more ginormous Russia or Africa-sized Greenland.
