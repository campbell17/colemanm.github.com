Endurance cyclist Mark Beaumont is best known for his "[around the world in 80 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZvQjndzISQ "Around the World in 80 Days on a Bike")" ride starting in Paris and crossing 3 continents in 78 days, putting him in the Guinness Book for the accomplishment.

A few years back he did this ride from Cairo to Cape Town across Africa â€” 41 days, 6,762 miles, 190K feet of climbing, 160 miles per day. To me it's as stunning in itself as the around the world ride. Some of the shots in this video of him traversing the Sahara through Sudan and the mountains of Ethiopia are incredible.
