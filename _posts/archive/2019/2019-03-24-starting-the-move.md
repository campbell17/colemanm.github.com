We've started moving what we can over to the new place. This weekend was our first free time to get some of it done, but we still had a couple of family commitments both Saturday and Sunday that occupied time. Between that and the kids in the way we got a few large items and boxes moved, but plenty left to go.

It's going to be a busy week.
