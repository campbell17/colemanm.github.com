{% include video.html id="3qHkcs3kG44" title="Interview with Naval Ravikant" %}

Naval’s thoughtful, measured perspective on most issues I find insightful and novel in a sea of people with hot takes and commentary around political issues in the zeitgeist. He’s got an interesting “long view” on a range of things from automation to economics to thinking and more.

There is a cult of personality around him, especially on Twitter, that seems to think he’s a “philosopher king” of the internet.  While that position is wildly overblown, he does have unique and unconventional point of view that’s refreshing. Worth a listen.
