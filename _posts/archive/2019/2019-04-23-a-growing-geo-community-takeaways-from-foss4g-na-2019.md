  title: "A Growing Geo Community: Takeaways from FOSS4G NA 2019"
---

I had a great time last week out in San Diego for this year's [FOSS4G-NA](https://2019.foss4g-na.org/ "FOSS4G-NA 2019"). This post I wrote for the company blog runs down general conference takeaways, plus a wavetops overview with best-of sessions I attended. It was a fantastic event, as always. The content was great, but the real win is getting to hang out with friends old and new and stay in touch with what everyone's working on:

> The key to getting the most out of a FOSS4G is the people. I haven’t attended one since 2013, but each one I’ve been to proves this out. The connections I’ve made at past events have been incredibly rewarding and lucrative over the past 8 years. I tell everyone thinking about going that to get the most out of it, you should be an active participant in the community. Sure the sessions are great content, but forming human relationships and expanding your network is the overarching goal. Such a positive, energetic crowd to spend time with!

Next up is the international show in Bucharest, then 2020 in Calgary.
