This year is the 60th anniversary of Miles Davis's legendary _[Kind of Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_of_Blue "Kind of Blue")_.

This video is a great explainer of the origins of _Kind of Blue_'s modal jazz style and the history behind how the group came together to make it happen.

I have no idea how many hundreds of times I've listened to this album over the years, but it's still in the frequent rotation to put on whenever I can't think of anything else. A default soundtrack for working or getting things done around the house.
