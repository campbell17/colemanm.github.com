The mountain stages of the Tour de France are some of my favorite events in sports. This edition of *Places* features a tribute to this year's [18th stage](https://www.letour.fr/en/stage-18 "Le Tour Stage 18"), and one of my favorite climbs of the Alps: the [Col du Galibier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Galibier "Col du Galibier"), a 2,600m HC beast with an epic descent on the other side.

Galibier was last climbed in the 2017 Tour, during an awesome [Stage 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfGd41u-IGc "Tour 2017 Stage 17") when Primož Roglič won the day on a route that included famous climbs on [Col de la Croix de Fer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_la_Croix_de_Fer "Col de la Croix de Fer"), [Col du Télégraphe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Télégraphe "Col du Telegraphe"), and the Galibier.

This year's stage route includes the Galibier and another HC fixture in [Col d'Izoard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_d'Izoard "Col d'Izoard"), also last seen in the 2017 edition when Warren Barguil had a [memorable mountaintop finish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml7FCihzsRE "Tour 2017 Stage 18") there.
