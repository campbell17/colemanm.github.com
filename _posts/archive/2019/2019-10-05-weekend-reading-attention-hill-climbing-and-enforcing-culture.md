### 🧠 [To Pay Attention, the Brain Uses Filters, Not a Spotlight](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-pay-attention-the-brain-uses-filters-not-a-spotlight-20190924/ "To Pay Attention, the Brain Uses Filters, Not a Spotlight")

> For a long time, because attention seemed so intricately tied up with consciousness and other complex functions, scientists assumed that it was first and foremost a cortical phenomenon. A major departure from that line of thinking came in 1984, when Francis Crick, known for his work on the structure of DNA, proposed that the attentional searchlight was controlled by a region deep in the brain called the thalamus, parts of which receive input from sensory domains and feed information to the cortex. He developed a theory in which the sensory thalamus acted not just as a relay station, but also as a gatekeeper — not just a bridge, but a sieve — staunching some of the flow of data to establish a certain level of focus.

Using the [hill climbing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing "Hill climbing") as an analogy for challenging yourself and achieving long-term goals.

The key takeaway of _[High Output Management](/books/grove-high-output-management/ "High Output Management")_:

> To paraphrase the book, the job of an executive is: to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.
>
> That's all.
>
> Not to decide. Not to break ties. Not to set strategy. Not to be the expert on every, or any topic. Just to sit in the room while the right people make good decisions in alignment with their values. And if they do, to endorse it. And if they don't, to send them back to try again.
