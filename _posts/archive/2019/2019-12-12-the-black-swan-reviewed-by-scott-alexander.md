This is the greatest, the Slate Star Codex review of Taleb's _[The Black Swan](/books/taleb-the-black-swan/ "The Black Swan")_. Taleb is (in)famous for railing on his intellectual adversaries, and also savaging reviews that (in his view) mis-read his work.

Scott plows right in. How is Taleb likely to respond to his review?

> Here are Talebâ€™s potential reactions graphed onto a power-law distribution. Although the likelihood of any given reaction continues to decline the further it is away from average, it declines much less quickly than on the bell curve. Violent assault is no longer such a remote possibility; maybe my considerations should even be dominated by it.

> So: are book reviews in Mediocristan or Extremistan?

I have to imagine that NNT would smile his way through this one.
