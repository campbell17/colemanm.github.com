I love that people out in the open source world still build things like this. It's an xterm-compatible renderer for accessing interactive map from a terminal console.

I even tried it from a console on an EC2 instance I've got. A quick telnet command gets you connected, a and z keys to zoom, arrow keys to pan:

    telnet mapscii.me

Funnily enough, I could even see this being useful if you needed to reference a map while on a command line on a remote server. Mostly it's a clever toy, but impressive nonetheless.
