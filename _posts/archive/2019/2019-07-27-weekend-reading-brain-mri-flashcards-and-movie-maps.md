🧠 [7 Tesla MRI of a Human Brain](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/649822v1 "7 Tesla MRI of a Human Brain")

This is one of the highest resolution scans ever performed on a human brain, at 100 micrometer resolution. Scroll down to see some awesome images.

👨🏻‍🏫 [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/ "Anki")

Anki is an open source framework for creating your own flash cards. A neat system for helping your kids with classwork, or even just testing yourself on topics.

> Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.

📽 [Cinemaps](http://www.andrewdegraff.com/moviemaps "Cinemaps")

I got lost in these works by Andrew DeGraff. They're super-detailed visualations of character movements and plot developments oriented spatially as the films move from beginning to end. My favorite is the multiple timeline architecture of _Back to the Future_.
