The physicist Richard Feynman's famous [1974 commencement address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science) on theories that pretend to be scientific:

> "But this long history of learning how to not fool ourselves—of having utter scientific integrity—is, I’m sorry to say, something that we haven’t specifically included in any particular course that I know of. We just hope you’ve caught on by osmosis.
>
> "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that."
