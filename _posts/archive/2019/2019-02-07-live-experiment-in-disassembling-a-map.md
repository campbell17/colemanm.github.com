{% include video.html id="DlfxrtE5O1o" title="A Live Experiment in Disassembling a Map" %}

This was a cool idea from cartographer [Daniel Huffman](https://twitter.com/pinakographos "Daniel Huffman on Twitter"). He live-streamed a walkthrough taking apart one of his [map projects](https://somethingaboutmaps.com/China "China") in Illustrator to see how he puts it all together.

I love this idea and am excited to see him do more like this down the road.
