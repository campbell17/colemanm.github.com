  title: "What Did the Earth Look Like?"

In the spirit of [yesterday's post]({{ site.url }}/post/the-history-of-the-world-on-one-map/ "History of the World on One Map") on the Earth of the past, this interactive map lets you browse back in time to see what oceans and landmasses looked like all the way back to 750 million years ago. Try typing in your address to see if you'd have been a resident of Gondwana or Laurasia if you took your time machine back to the Triassic.

When I read _[Annals of the Former World]({{ site.url }}/post/annals-of-the-former-world/ "Annals of the Former World")_ some years back, the hardest thing to wrap my head around with geologic time was the sheer scale of what "100 million years" looks like. No matter how many of the comparisons, scale bars, or timelines I see, it's still mind-blowing to think about continents converging, separating, and reconverging repeatedly throughout history.
