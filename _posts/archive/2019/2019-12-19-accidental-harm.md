This piece resonated in the wake of the mess around California's [AB5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Assembly_Bill_5_(2019) "AB5") legislation, which puts limitations on classifying workers as independent contractors. The [backlash to AB5](https://twitter.com/LorenaSGonzalez/status/1207373213262467072 "AB5 dialog") shows how it's a case study in unintended consequences.

The modern interventionist's view wildly overestimates how well problems are understood, and what the second- or third-order consequences of an intervention might be.

I'm reminded here of Hayek's quote on economics (applicable to any uncertain, massively complex field):

> The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.

In complicated, many-sided issues like the AB5 one, it makes sense to take small steps to react to the issue at hand (which is, admittedly, a mess and imperfect for employees). Sweeping steps like AB5 _feel_ good and address one problem while simultaneously generating multiple others.
