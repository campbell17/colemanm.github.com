  title: "The All Things Tech History List"
---

Through a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/pierce/status/1180193895587577856 "Tech history on Twitter") I ran across this running catalog of resources on the history of the tech industry — books, articles, movies, and more. A definitive list of content. There are some great recommendations here that I’d never heard of, especially in the books and podcasts sections.

I’ve got a copy of _[The Dream Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/722412.The_Dream_Machine "The Dream Machine")_ that I’m planning on digging into next, a history of personal computing and biography of [JCR Licklider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider "JCR Licklider").
