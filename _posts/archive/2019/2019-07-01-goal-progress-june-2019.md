So that's a wrap on the month of June. This was my best month so far in terms of a consistent plan and feeling more productive with staying on target. Even with an out-of-town trip to visit [the Cape]({{ site.url }}/post/cape-canaveral/ "Cape Canaveral") and Jacksonville for a few days, which threw a brief wrench into the running plan, I was still able to climb enough above the target line get to my highest mark so far.

| Activity       | Progress     | Pace         | Goal         | Plus-Minus                       |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 253.54 miles | 247.95 miles | 500 miles    | <span class="green">+5.59</span> |
| **Meditation** | 1920 minutes | 1810 minutes | 3650 minutes | <span class="green">+110</span>  |
| **Reading**    | 28 books     | 22.32 books  | 50 books     | <span class="green">+5.68</span> |

At some point mid-month I was actually about +10 miles over the goal line for running, but a 4 or 5 day break for that trip chopped it back down. It's okay, though, since that's exactly the point in overachieving for brief periods â€” creating the flexibility to go off-schedule if needed. I completed the [Shore Acres running project]({{ site.url }}/post/run-shore-acres-complete/ "Run Shore Acres Complete"), got under contract with a buyer for the old house, and had an [all-clear follow up]({{ site.url }}/post/18-months-down/ "18 Months Down") visit last weekend.

We're halfway through the year and still tracking on all the goals. Let's see what July's got in store.
