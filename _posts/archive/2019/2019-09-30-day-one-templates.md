[Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/ "Day One") is an excellent app for iOS and macOS for personal journaling. I've had it for a number of years, but have always been fairly irregular in my usage. Most of what I log there is photos of the kids and other kid-related memories and activities we do.

This new feature adds support for templates, which give you a bit of a prompt to fill out once a day. It's an interesting idea to make documenting a more regular activity. When I was more active (prior to using this blog largely in this capacity) I would just scratch down quickly what I was thinking about. But the blank canvas to write on left me stumped sometimes as to what to write. I'll try out the Day One "5 Minute PM" template for a couple weeks at night and see where that leads.
