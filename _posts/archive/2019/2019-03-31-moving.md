We've now got the bulk of our essentials sorted through and moved over to the new house. There's plenty of work left to do to get our old house emptied and ready for listing, but the hard work is done. Now comes the fun part of getting situated and organized in the new place to enjoy it.

A 26' truck, 3 trips between houses, and 1 trip to the storage unit got us all set to now reduce the problem to basic cleaning and finishing a handful of half-done projects in the old house.

The kids are all set with their stuff at the new place — already excited about 5 minute walks to the park!
