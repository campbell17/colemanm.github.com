As a keyboard shortcut user, I'm always on the hunt for ways to keep my hands on the keoard. Shortcut snippet tools like TextExpander are also catnip for speeding up typing. I've gotten used to many of the emoji shortcuts in Slack (the colon-based `:thumbsup:` type snippets), and this extension for Alfred extends this to the wider macOS environment. Pretty handy.
