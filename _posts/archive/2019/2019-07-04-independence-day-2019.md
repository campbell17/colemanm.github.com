We had a typical, yet action-packed day for the 4th. The kids had a sleepover with their cousins, so I did get about an hour of reading in total silence this morning, which was certainly *not* typical.

But after that they did swimming and cookout up at my folks' place, then swimming and more food over at the neighbor's house. Then we got to go down to the Snell Isle Bridge to watch the downtown fireworks with friends.
