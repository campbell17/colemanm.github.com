A [newsletter](https://antonhowes.substack.com/ "Anton Howes") from [Dr. Anton Howes](https://twitter.com/antonhowes "Anton Howes on Twitter"), a historian studying innovation and the Industrial Revolution.

> Iâ€™m a historian of innovation. I write mostly about the causes of Britainâ€™s Industrial Revolution, focusing on the lives of the individual innovators who made it happen. Iâ€™m interested in everything from the exploits of sixteenth-century alchemists to the schemes of Victorian engineers. My research explores why they became innovators, and the institutions they created to promote innovation even further.

This connects nicely with the recent "[progress studies](/post/progress-studies/ "Progress Studies")" movement.
