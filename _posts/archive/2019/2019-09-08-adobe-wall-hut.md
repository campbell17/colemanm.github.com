Another fun one from the [Primitive Technology](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA "Primitive Technology YouTube") channel. I [previously linked](/post/primitive-technology/ "Primitive Technology") to his videos a few months back. This time he builds a stacked brick wall around a new thatched hut out of clay bricks. The patience and craftsmanship required to build the things he does is truly admirable.

I think we'd all be mentally healthier if we spent more time disconnecting and creating things. If only I had the Queensland jungle in my backyard!
