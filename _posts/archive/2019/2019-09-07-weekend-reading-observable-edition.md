*This week's links are all interactive notebooks on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/ ""Observable"). Their Explore section always highlights interesting things people are creating. A great learning tool for playing with data and code to see how it works.*

### ‚å®Ô∏è [The Enigma Machine](https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/enigma-machine "The Enigma Machine")

Easily the most impressive interactive notebook I've ever seen. This one from Tom shows the electromechanical pathways of the German [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) at work ‚Äî enter a character and see how the rotors and circuits encrypt text. 

### üö≤ [A Bicycle Drivetrain Analyzer](https://observablehq.com/@tysonanderson/bicycle-drivetrain-analyzer "A Bicycle Drivetrain Analyzer")

Another great example of the power of interactive programs. This one lets you compute bicycle chainring gear ratios by speed setting. You can add multiple cassettes and chainrings to compare:

### üåç [Mapping the Mediterranean](https://observablehq.com/@toja/mapping-the-mediterranean "Mapping the Mediterranean")

Have to include a map example. Here the author brings in DEM data then styles and generates it all in code with GDAL for data manipulation and D3 for graphics.
