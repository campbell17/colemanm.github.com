Since I’ve been following the [progress studies](/post/progress-studies/ "Progress Studies") movement and Jason Crawford’s [Roots of Progress](https://rootsofprogress.org/ "Roots of Progress") blog, it was cool to see video of his talk on the history of steel from a San Francisco meetup a few weeks ago.
