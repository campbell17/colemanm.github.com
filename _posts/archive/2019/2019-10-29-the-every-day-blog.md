Inspired by Fred Wilson’s [AVC](https://avc.com/ "AVC") blog, I started posting something every day here last year [on October 4th](/post/high-security-high-usability/ "High Security, High Usability"). The 1 year mark passed by and I didn’t even notice. It’s become such a part of my mental routine to keep up with that it’s become pretty painless.

Most of my posts are topics I find interesting or links I run across. I find myself zeroing in on themes that tend to appear in my reading patterns. Through the process I’ve also come up with a few recurring “series” type posts to do regularly:

* **[Weekend Reading](/post/weekend-reading-ancient-text-starlink-and-chinese-origins/ "Weekend Reading: Ancient Text, StarLink, and Chinese Origins")** — a link list of 3 recent interesting things, posted on Saturdays
* **[Places](/post/places-the-kolyma-river/ "Places: The Kolyma River")** — a series where I highlight interesting geographies
* **[Best Songs](/post/best-songs-pt-8-death-letter/ "Best Songs, Pt. 8: Death Letter")** — infrequently logging my personal favorites
* **[Book Reviews](/post/managerial-leverage/ "Managerial Leverage")** — also infrequent, but enjoyable to write when I find the time
* **[Goal Progress](/post/goal-progress-september-2019/ "Goal Progress: September 2019")** — on the 1st of each month, a review of progress against personal goals for the prior month

One healthy side effect of the blogging habit has been a reduction in social media usage. I still flip through Twitter occasionally, but the majority of my reading has converted to books, [RSS](/post/the-state-of-rss/ "The State of RSS") feeds, and a handful of [newsletters](/post/a-resurgence-of-email/ "A Resurgence of Email"). Through this commitment to writing every day, I’ve had to pare down the amount of time I burn on “wasteful” activities — TV/movies, gaming, etc. Knowing that I have a commitment to keep up with a regular blogging pattern forces me to stay on task with relevant writing and reading.

One thing I would like to explore soon is how I might be able to schedule posts to go out. Since I write and publish this site with [Jekyll](/post/using-jekyll-collections-to-build-a-library/ "Jekyll Collections to Build a Library") and [Netlify](/post/netlify-for-content-management-and-hosting/ "Netlify for Content Management and Hosting"), it’s all managed in a git repository, without a good way to schedule future posts. So I’ve forgotten to push my changes a number of times, discovering a day late that I never published something. I’m toying with the idea of moving to something like [Ghost](https://ghost.org "Ghost") for a more full-featured writing environment. I’ll mess around with that over the next couple of months and see if there’s something there.

Even though I hit the 1-year streak, I have no plans to stop the every day publishing. Let’s keep this train moving.
