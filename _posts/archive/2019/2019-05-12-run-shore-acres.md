For no particular reason I decided to try and run every street segment in my neighborhood. A while ago I saw this project from ultrarunner Rickey Gates where he ran [every single street in San Francisco](https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a25628489/ultrarunner-rickey-gates-runs-san-francisco-streets/). Of course my neighborhood is a fair bit smaller, but attempting it will keep things interesting. You can already see the progress zigzagging through the street spurs of waterfront property, with canals in between each row of houses.

I've been doing a route regularly out onto Venetian Isles. This will mix it up and give me a chance to see the rest of the neighborhood. If I get it done soonish I'll extend to Snell Isle to the south. My plan is to also download all the track line and point data and create a custom map.
