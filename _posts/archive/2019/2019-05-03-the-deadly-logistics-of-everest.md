{% include video.html id="yU2kANHyF1w" title="The Deadly Logistics of Everest" %}

Earlier this week I finished reading Jon Krakauer's _[Into Thin Air]({{ site.url }}/books/krakauer-into-thin-air/ "Into Thin Air")_, his account of climbing Mount Everest and surviving the [1996 Everest disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Mount_Everest_disaster "1996 Everest Disaster"). The book reads like a thriller, giving the account of how an expedition team prepares for the climb, including the experience in country beforehand and acclimatization process for weeks leading up to the climb.

While reading it, I found myself wishing I had the visual aid of maps of the route, photos of the camps, and what certain of the landmarks (like the dangerous [Khumbu Icefall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khumbu_Icefall "Khumbu Icefall")) actually look like. This video gives a good sense of the monumental scale of the challenge of climbing the 29,000' peak.
