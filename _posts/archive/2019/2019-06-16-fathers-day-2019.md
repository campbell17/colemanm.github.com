I'm not a big holiday person, so I don't think much about it when something like Father's Day rolls around.

Simple morning with the kids doing breakfast, then I spent most of the day over at the old place getting it prepped for listing this week. Home Depot trips, painting, yard work, and power washing. Looking forward to getting that thing sold.

Elyse made me a great card this morning. She knows I love maps!
