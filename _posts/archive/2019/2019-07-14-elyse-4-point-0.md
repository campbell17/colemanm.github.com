Elyse just had her 4th birthday this weekend!

She picked out her own theme, her own cake, and wanted to have her party at Jump Station here in town. Tons of her friends and family came out, so it was great to see everyone and always fun to see her living it up with all of her friends.

Everett also had a blast there running all over the place climbing, jumping, and sliding with the older kids.

When we got home she had a big time opening all of her gifts â€” been playing with them all non-stop since. We also took a nice bike ride together down to the park and back, which she always loves, contrary to this video where she's complaining about tired legs:
