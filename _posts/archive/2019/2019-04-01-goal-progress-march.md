Month three is in the books. A seriously eventful month for us, so I'm surprised I was able to stay ahead of the curve.

| Activity       | Progress     | Pace         | Goal         | Plus-Minus                       |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 123.65 miles | 123.29 miles | 500 miles    | <span class="green">+0.36</span> |
| **Meditation** | 975 minutes  | 900 minutes  | 3650 minutes | <span class="green">+75</span>   |
| **Reading**    | 15 books     | 11.1 books   | 50 books     | <span class="green">+3.90</span> |

We closed on the [new house]({{ site.url }}/post/the-new-house/ "The New House") on the 15th, had an [out-of-town trip]({{ site.url }}/post/a-drive-through-central-florida/ "A Drive Through Central Florida") to Jacksonville right after. Plus there was packing, [moving]({{ site.url }}/post/moving/ "Moving"), and child-management throughout. With all that going on I'm surprised I was able to stay on track, particularly with the running. I know last month my main observation about my performance was the _fewer_, _longer_ runs I was planning to avoid. Turns out I didn't do a great job. This month I'll chalk that up as intentional — all of the time commitments this month made me push harder on the days I could run to make sure I could get in the miles and stay on track.

There's still plenty to be done on the house front, but we're past the worst of it. For April, I'm going to target more frequent runs in the ballpark of 4 miles and see how that works.
