I don't listen to a lot of modern blues artists. The lo-fi, minimalist sound of The White Stripes was always the best format for a blues act, in my opinion.

I love this rendition of Son House's *Death Letter Blues*. This also appeared on the studio recording of _[De Stijl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl_(album) "De Stijl")_, but I like the live take:
