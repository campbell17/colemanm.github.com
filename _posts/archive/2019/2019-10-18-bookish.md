This is a handy tool for searching book metadata, built by Tom MacWright. It’s a “universal converter” for book IDs in various services, like Goodreads, OpenLibrary, and WorldCat.

It’s [open source](https://github.com/tmcw/bookish "bookish") and also has an [API](https://github.com/tmcw/bookish-api "bookish-api"). I’ll have to see about factoring these other IDs into my own [Library](/books/ "Library") reading log.
