I still haven't published the long backstory on my cancer battle from 2017. It's still a work-in-progress. There's a draft going, but I want to make sure I do justice to the whole story properly, and it's a little hard to spend time on. One day soon I'll get it out there.

I mentioned a bit about my immunotherapy treatment a few weeks ago. Long story short is that there's been good news recently, uneventful scans and visits (other than those 90 minute sessions in the MRI tube â€” not a good time there).

A quick update from today's visit with the oncologist: I've graduated from a monthly schedule of  checkups and diagnostic bloodwork to a 3-month cycle. After having multiple visits over there per week, to only a couple per month, then monthly, spending less time in that office is a welcome change.
