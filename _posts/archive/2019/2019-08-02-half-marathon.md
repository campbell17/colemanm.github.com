I've committed myself to running my [first half marathon](http://www.floridahalloweenhalfathon.com/ "Halloween Half Marathon"), coming up in October. This sort of happened on a challenge from a couple folks at work. I didn't really intend to throw something like this into the schedule that could interrupt my regular goal progress, but in looking at Strava's training plans, their half marathon one starts mid August and scales up in a way I think I can tackle relatively comfortably. It starts off with easy runs in the 40-60 minute range, with weekend long runs up to 75-90 minutes. I'll need to bring the pace down from my recent patterns if I want to build that level of endurance.

August 19th is the first day of the training calendar. Going to grind on until then and see if I can get comfortable with longer sustained times.
