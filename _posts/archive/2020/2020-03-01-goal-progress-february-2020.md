A quick update for February. No big revelations or movements on goals, just slight progress.

| Activity       | Progress    | Pace        | Goal         | Plus-Minus                      |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 97.76 miles | 107 miles   | 650 miles    | <span class="red">-9.09</span>  |
| **Meditation** | 600 minutes | 513 minutes | 3120 minutes | <span class="green">+87</span>  |
| **Reading**    | 4 books     | 4.93 books  | 30 books     | <span class="red">-0.93</span>  |

I've struggled with building longer meditation sessions into my routine. I think the only way it's going to happen is if I can get a pattern of sitting down in the morning before the kids are up. At night things are just too unpredictable — kids might stay up late, too tired, have to do runs, unmotivated.

Running was a little better than last month. I stayed a bit ahead of the curve through the month to close the deficit a bit, but still had several multi-day-off periods.

As I'd mentioned in my [Goals](/post/2020-goals/ "2020 Goals") post at the start of the year, I plan to read some deeper books this year so I reduced the total number. A focus on quality material and better retention is the priority. I also have about 6 or 7 in motion right now, which is abnormally high even for me.
