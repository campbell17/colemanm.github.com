A sign your tool, library, community, or science has made it is when it gets the [`awesome`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome "awesome lists") lists treatment.

I've got an upcoming post in the works on my experiences with [Roam](/post/roam-a-tool-for-metacognition/ "Roam: A Tool for Metacognition") so far. Lots of the resources listed here are great primers on how others are using it.
