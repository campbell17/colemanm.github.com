I'm deeper these days into [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/ "Roam Research") for info storage and notes. It empowers a looser, free-form version of writing (or as Roam describes it "networked thought") that's hard to do in a linear note document. I've been working up a post on Roam and where I feel it fitting into my own workflow.

This piece gives a good overview of it and how it's different from other knowledge management systems.
