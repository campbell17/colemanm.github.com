### 🗺 [turf-tagger](https://fulcrumapp.github.io/turf-tagger/ "turf-tagger")

[Bryan](https://twitter.com/brymcbride "Bryan McBride") put together this neat little utility for merging point data with containing polygon attributes with spatial join queries. It uses [Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/ "Turf.js") to do the geoprocess in the browser.

### 🚀 [Mars Curiosity High-Res Panorama](https://phys.org/news/2020-03-curiosity-mars-rover-snaps-highest-resolution.html "Mars Curiosity High-Res Panorama")

Amazing photography of the Mars surface:

> NASA's Curiosity rover has captured its highest-resolution panorama yet of the Martian surface. Composed of more than 1,000 images taken during the 2019 Thanksgiving holiday and carefully assembled over the ensuing months, the composite contains 1.8 billion pixels of Martian landscape. The rover's Mast Camera, or Mastcam, used its telephoto lens to produce the panorama; meanwhile, it relied on its medium-angle lens to produce a lower-resolution, nearly 650-million-pixel panorama that includes the rover's deck and robotic arm.

> 1. **“Easy” because there’s a delay between benefit and cost.**
>
> The cost of exercising is immediate. Exercise hurts while you’re doing it, and the harder the exercise the more the hurt.  Investing is different. It has a cost, just like exercising. But its costs can be delayed by years.
>
> Whenever there’s a delay between benefit and cost, the benefits always seem easier than they are. And whenever the benefits seem easier than they are, people take risks they shouldn’t. It’s why there are investing bubbles, but not exercise bubbles.
