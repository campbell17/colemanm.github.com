I found and started testing out Raindrop.io for managing bookmarks. Pinboard has been my go-to for this for years, to which I've added the resurrected Instapaper for anything like articles (to support Readwise flow).

The lack of a good mobile app for Pinboard makes that process pretty weak; and I'd say I end up adding half my bookmarks and "read later" stuff from the iPhone.

I imported all the bookmarks I had in Pinboard over there, which worked perfectly smooth. Raindrop's desktop macOS app is fantastic, as well.

Recommended so far. May write about it in more detail later once I get a feel for how it fits into my personal process.
