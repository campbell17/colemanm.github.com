This talk from Jonathan Lim gives a good overview of how the newest treatments for cancer work â€”Â radiation/chemo, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and ecDNA.

I wrote about my experience with immunotherapy and how it's different in [The Infinity Machine](/post/the-infinity-machine/ "The Infinity Machine") a couple months ago, but this video gives a good animated visual example of how it works.
