This tool lets you plunge back into computing history and read the [RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments "RFCs") published over the years since the early days of the ARPANET. I've been reading _[Where Wizards Stay Up Late](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/281818.Where_Wizards_Stay_Up_Late "Where Wizards Stay Up Late")_, which tells the interesting story behind how RFCs came to be the medium for proposing standards on the internet.

A few notable ones:

* Steve Crocker's [RFC 1 ](http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc1 "RFC 1")on IMP software (ARPANET's "Interface Message Processors", basically dedicated computers for network communication queueing)
* Vint Cerf's [RFC 675](http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc675 "RFC 675") on TCP
* John Melvin and Richard Watson's [RFC 97](http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc97 "RFC 97") on telnet
* AK Bhushan's [RFC 114](http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc114 "RFC 114") on FTP
