So March has wrapped, probably the longest month we've had in many years.

The shake-up in schedule, work-life patterns, and disruptions in everything from kids, to family, to day-to-day activities played absolute hell with my progress on goals.

| Activity       | Progress     | Pace        | Goal         | Plus-Minus                      |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 141.04 miles | 162 miles   | 650 miles    | <span class="red">-21.01</span> |
| **Meditation** | 860 minutes  | 778 minutes | 3120 minutes | <span class="green">+82</span>  |
| **Reading**    | 6 books      | 7.48 books  | 30 books     | <span class="red">-1.48</span>  |

Let's start with the "okay" news. On the meditation front I've been doing alright, but made a decision to switch from using Headspace to [Oak](https://www.oakmeditation.com/ "Oak Meditation"). This was partially to shake up what was feeling like a lack of improvement, but I recognize that the [tool is not the problem](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/e9108483-d8ee-4032-b3f9-2abe934c7d20 "The poor carpenter blames his shoddy tools") when it comes to disciplined practice of any sort. After reading Tom's [comments on Oak](https://macwright.org/2020/03/17/meditation.html "Meditation"), I decided to give it a shot. I've been preferring unguided modes to help work on concentration myself; the cues can actually be a distraction in that way once you know what you're supposed to be doing. Will see what happens here over the next month with our [new normal](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615370/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-18-months/ "We're not going back to normal").

Running was an unmitigated disaster this month. Way too many days off and missed for no particular reason other than the mental disruption in the daily flow. It's counterintuitive that more time indoors and at home would make _less_ time for running (it really hasn't), but not having clear breakpoints in the day, plus the kids being home 100% of the time, has made this a difficult adjustment for things like exercise. I'm going to make a concerted effort to do mid-day runs with the kids in tow, even if that means higher quantity of shorter workouts. I've got to figure out a way to get a pattern going again.

Books appear behind, but don't feel that way. I've done exactly what I'd intended all along at the start of the year, which was [reading longer, deeper books](/post/2020-goals/ "2020 Goals") — quality over quantity. I've really enjoyed the thread I've been following with the history of tech, and I've got a few more in the queue I'm looking forward to.
