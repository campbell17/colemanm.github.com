I'm currently reading his book _[How to Take Smart Notes](/books/ahrens-how-to-take-smart-notes/ "How to Take Smart Notes")_, which is based on, and talks a lot about sociologist [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann "Niklas Luhmann")'s [Zettelkasten](https://medium.com/@mosessampaul/zettelkasten-method-of-knowledge-management-the-second-brain-218108942514 "Zettelkasten") system.
