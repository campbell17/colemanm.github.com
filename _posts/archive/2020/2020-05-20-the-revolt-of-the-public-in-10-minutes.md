Author Martin Gurri posted this quick 10 minute summary of his book _[The Revolt of the Public](/books/gurri-the-revolt-of-the-public/ "The Revolt of the Public")_. It was one of my favorite recent reads, and in this video he does an excellent job summarizing his key diagnosis of what's behind the degradation of authority from institutions and dissolution of public trust in them.

His insights connect information dissemination, institutions, and authority — the public expects unrealistic levels of service and expertise from institutions, while institutions also promise far more than they're capable of delivering. This divide, happening in a world with instantaneous (over)communication gets us to where we are today.
