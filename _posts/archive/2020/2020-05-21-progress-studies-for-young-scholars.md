Jason Crawford on Roots of Progress's [new program](https://progressstudies.school/ "Progress Studies School") for high school students:

> Progress Studies for Young Scholars launches in June as a summer program, with daily online learning activities for 6 weeks. Weâ€™ll be covering the history of technology and invention: the challenges of life and work and how we solved them, leading to the amazing increase in living standards over the last few centuries. Topics will include the advances in materials; automation of manufacturing and agriculture; the progression of energy from steam to oil to electricity; how railroads, cars and airplanes shrank the world; the conquest of infectious disease through sanitation, vaccines, and antibiotics; and the rise of computers and the Internet. The course will also prompt students to consider the future of progress, and what part they want to play in it.

It's great to see the progress studies movement bearing fruit in education. The high school age is a perfect place to begin with teaching the history of science, innovation, and technology.
