We celebrated the new year last night with the family during our trip together, a fairly low-key affair. Hard to believe now that we've reached a year number that sounds like science fiction: 2020.

I just got back today after a whirlwind Christmas and leaving town right after, so haven't had time yet to articulate the year's goals into a post. Hopefully I'll get that out tomorrow. A few more days off with the family, then the rocket takes off into the new year.
