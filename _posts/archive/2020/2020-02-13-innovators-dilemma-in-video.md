I was looking around for a summary of Clayton Christensen's _[Innovator's Dilemma](/books/christensen-the-innovators-dilemma/ "The Innovator's Dilemma")_ and ran across this neat YouTube channel that does book summaries in visual form, with drawings representing the concepts in the book.

It's a cool way of getting a different presentation of subject matter, especially of nonfiction and business books.
