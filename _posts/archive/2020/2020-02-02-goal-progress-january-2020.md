The first month of 2020 is already in the books. 31 days blew by already?

It’s been a rollercoaster of a first few weeks, with some vacation at New Years, shot out of a cannon with a reinvigorated team at work, a [trip to Miami](/post/miami-2019/ "Miami"), and a trip to Jacksonville.

I already fell behind on the targets with all that’s been going on. Once I can fall into a better rhythm with some normalcy in the schedule (which should be happening over the next couple weeks), I think I’ll be fine to catch up.

| Activity       | Progress    | Pace        | Goal         | Plus-Minus                      |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 43.14 miles | 55 miles    | 650 miles    | <span class="red">-12.07</span> |
| **Meditation** | 350 minutes | 265 minutes | 3120 minutes | <span class="green">+85</span>  |
| **Reading**    | 2 books     | 2.55 books  | 30 books     | <span class="red">-0.55</span>  |

My running’s been reasonable, if not frequent enough to stay on track with the increased goal over last year.

Reading I intentionally re-prioritized some longer stuff, and I’ve been working through a couple that are great so far, but one in particular leads down all sorts of Wikipedia side trails while reading it.
