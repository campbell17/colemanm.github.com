This one cropped up through Google's [Earth View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh?hl=en "Earth View") Chrome extension.

The [Tes River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tes_River "Tes River") runs east to west into northwest Mongolia from the [Sayan Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayan_Mountains "Sayan Mountains") in Siberia.

It empties into the [Uvs Nuur Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvs_Lake_Basin "Uvs Nuur Basin"), a [UNESCO World Heritage site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/769 "Uvs Nuur").

The river's floodplain looks amazing from the air, a 10+ mile wide swath with dozens of smaller streams formed as the main course has meandered all over and stranded oxbows and dropped bands of sediment.
