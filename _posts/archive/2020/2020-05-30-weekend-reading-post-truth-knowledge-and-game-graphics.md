### ⚖️ [The Way Out of Post-truth](https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/commentary/way-out-post-truth "The Way Out of Post-truth")

Another razor sharp analysis from Gurri:

> The collapse of trust in our leading institutions has exiled the 21st century to the Siberia of post-truth. I want to be clear about what this means. Reality has not changed. It’s still unyielding. Facts today are partial and contradictory—but that’s always been the case. Post-truth, as I define it, signifies a moment of sharply divergent perspectives on every subject or event, without a trusted authority in the room to settle the matter. A telling symptom is that we no longer care to persuade. We aim to impose our facts and annihilate theirs, a process closer to intellectual holy war than to critical thinking.

### 🧠 [A Simplified "Pretence of Knowledge"](https://medium.com/@neilchilson/a-simplified-pretence-of-knowledge-111f5f25a36d "A Simplified Pretence of Knowledge")

A good summary of Hayek's famous 1974 address, "[A Pretence of Knowledge](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1974/hayek/lecture/ "A Pretence of Knowledge")." Thinking you can "figure everything out" with expertise is dangerous.

> If we truly wish to improve society, we must be humble and realize the bounds of what is possible with social science. Rather than attempting to shape society directly like a sculptor shapes a statue, we must seek instead to understand and to create the right environment for progress, like a gardener in a garden. Overconfidence in the use of science to control society will make a man a tyrant, and will lead to the destruction of a civilization which no brain has designed, but which has instead grown from the free efforts of millions of individuals.

### 🕹 [GTA V Graphics Study](http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/ "GTA V Graphics Study")

An interesting dive into the crazy amount of technique that goes into modern video game graphics.
