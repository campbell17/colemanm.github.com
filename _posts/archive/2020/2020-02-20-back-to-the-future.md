New York Times writer Ross Douthat has a new book out called _[The Decadent Society](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50053432-the-decadent-society "The Decadent Society")_, which explores how we've arrived in a period of (in the book's terms) stagnation, repetition, sterility, and sclerosis. This post is a review of the book from Peter Thiel, who's been talking about the problems with stagnation and lack of progress for a decade or more.
