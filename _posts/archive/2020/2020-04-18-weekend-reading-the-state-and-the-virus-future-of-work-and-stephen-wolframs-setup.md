### 🏛 [The Individual, the State, and the Virus](http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/the-individual-the-state-and-the-virus/ "The Individual, the State, and the Virus")

### ⌨️ [Stephen Wolfram's Personal Infrastructure](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/ "Stephen Wolfram's Personal Infrastructure")

Mathematician and computer scientist Stephen Wolfram wrote this epic essay on his personal productivity infrastructure.
