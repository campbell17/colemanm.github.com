### 📂 [The Anti-Portfolio](https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio "The Anti-Portfolio")

Bessemer maintains this page of companies they passed investing on. I like the idea of publicly acknowledging your big misses or errors as an organizational accountability tool. Some big names here like eBay, Airbnb, Google, and FedEx.

### 🌏 [Downlink 2.0](https://acolangelo.com/blog/downlink-2 "Downlink 2.0")

Almost a year ago I [shared a link](/post/weekend-reading-product-market-fit-stripes-5th-hub-and-downlink/ "Weekend Reading: Product Market Fit, Stripe's 5th Hub, and Downlink") to the first version of Downlink. The main feature added here is you can create your own custom views by putting a bounding box around your area of interest. Then you'll get a live look at the Earth as your desktop background.

### 🐦 [nucoll](https://github.com/jdevoo/nucoll "nucoll")

A collection tool for retrieving and analyzing Twitter data. I've seen some neat social network analyses shared from folks that have used this to map degree relationships between Twitter accounts.
