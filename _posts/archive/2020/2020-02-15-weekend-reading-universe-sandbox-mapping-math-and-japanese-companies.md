### ðŸŒŒ [Universe Sandbox](http://universesandbox.com/ "Universe Sandbox")

This is a physics simulator that replicates the physics of interstellar objects. You can simulate massive planetary collisions or supernovae in the Earth's solar system, in case you want to see what would happen.

### ðŸ§® [The Map of Mathematics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-map-of-mathematics-20200213/ "The Map of Mathematics")

A neat catalog "map" of mathematics, with visualizations of things like prime numbers, symmetry, calculus, and more. Quanta Magazine does fantastic work.

> In 2019, there were over 33,000 businesses in Japan over a century old, according to research firm Teikoku Data Bank. The oldest hotel in the world has been open since 705 in Yamanashi and confectioner Ichimonjiya Wasuke has been selling sweet treats in Kyoto since 1000. Osaka-based construction giant Takenaka was founded in 1610, while even some global Japanese brands like Suntory and Nintendo have unexpectedly long histories stretching back to the 1800s.
