### ðŸŽ¥ [Beastie Boys Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys_Story "Beastie Boys Story")

We watched this a couple nights ago. It's hard to tell how objectively good it was, but I loved the heck out of it as a decades-long fan.

### ðŸ”— [Linkrot](https://macwright.org/2020/05/02/linkrot.html "Linkrot")

I'll have to try out this tool that Tom built for checking links. When I've run those SEM tools that check old links, I get sad seeing how many are redirected, 404'd, or dead.

### ðŸ“¹ [Screencasting Technical Guide](https://howtoegghead.com/instructor/screencasting/ "Screencasting Technical Guide")

This is an excellent walkthrough on how to make screencasts. I've done my own tinkering around with ScreenFlow to make a few things for Fulcrum. It's something I want to do more of eventually. A good resource for gear + tools, preparation, and editing.
