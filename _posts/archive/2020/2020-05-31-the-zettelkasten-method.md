Lately I've been [pouring time into Roam](/post/getting-comfortable-with-roam/ "Getting Comfortable with Roam"), finding ways to improve my long-term memory, and reading about [taking notes](/post/a-system-for-publishing-evergreen-notes/ "A System for Publishing Evergreen Notes"), all in service of getting better at synthesizing new ideas.

Central to all of these is the Zettelkasten method of note-taking, a fancy-sounding German word for "note box."

In addition to S√∂nke Ahrens's excellent book on the topic, [this post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1 "The Zettelkasten Method") offers a deeper look into the mechanics of the system.
