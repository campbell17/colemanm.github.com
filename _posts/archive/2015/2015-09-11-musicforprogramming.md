Music for Programming is a series of ambient audio mixes curated by [@datassette](https://twitter.com/datassette/), distributed as a [podcast](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/music-for-programming/id500565620), but also downloadable mp3s.

I love these, they're go-to listening for me when writing, on an airplane, or anywhere else where I want some audio without distraction. Episode 4 from [Com Truise](http://musicforprogramming.net/?c=four) is particularly awesome.

I you like MFP, check out Seth Haley's [Komputer Cast](http://comtruise.com/kc/) (he's the man behind Com Truise). It's been on hiatus for a while, but I'd love to see some more episodes down the road.
