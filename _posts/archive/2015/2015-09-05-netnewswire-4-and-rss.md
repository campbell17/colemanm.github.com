[NetNewsWire 4.0](http://netnewswireapp.com/) just dropped for Mac and iOS, after two years in a beta. Dan Moren is skeptical:

> ...the real question is whether an RSS reader is still software that people get worked up about. With the demise of longtime RSS staple Google Reader and the incursion of social networks and alternative news reading apps like Flipboard, Nuzzel, and soon Apple News, an RSS reader seems decidedly last decade.

I started using NNW long ago, but only for a short while since Google Reader got good around that time (2008?). It was nice to have cached offline versions of articles on the desktop. I'm interested to check out what's different this time around. The screenshots look like a very stripped down and simplified reader interface.

Since Google Reader shutdown in 2013, I switched right over to [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) and have been loving it ever since. It's not free, which means (presumably) the developer can actually support it and keep it running. It's well worth the $3 per month it costs, for me. On iOS I'm using [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/ios/) which integrates nicely. I still use RSS all the time, so I hope blogs and sites continue to publish content feeds. At this point every CMS has RSS or Atom support built in, so there's no reason not to.
