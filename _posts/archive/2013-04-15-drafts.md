Through a number of recommendations around the web, I've started using [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts), an iOS app with an interesting workflow model that's helping me replace a number of input channels for capturing different pieces of information while on-the-go.

It's positioned primarily as a text editor or note-taking app for iOS, but it introduces a fundamentally different approach to the **capture &rarr; process** flow than most other solutions I've tried, even ones that I like. Like most heavy mobile users, I have a suite of apps I use constantly to capture different inputs: [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/OmniFocus/) for task management, Mail for email, [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) for notes and Markdown content, [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) for calendar items, and others. I love each of these apps for what they do, but speed is paramount for capture to be truly _ubiquitous_, at least for me. And I sometimes find myself swiping around looking for the right app to put something.

The way Drafts handles input is novel because it puts the _content_ first, and the _action_ second. You can jot something down, then decide how to process it. Sometimes it's a to-do, sometimes a draft of an email, and sometimes just a quick note. I love the idea of starting with a bit of text, then picking the chute down which to send it in step two. Open the app and its ready for some text; no need to add titles to text files, create a new document, or any other hurdle, just start typing. It's  my new method for throwing things in the OmniFocus inbox[^omnifocus-siri].

Depending on the exact wording of the quick note, it could end up as a to-do in my OF inbox:

* **Set up phone call with John &rarr; Add to OmniFocus**

Then later become an appointment for the calendar:

* **Conference call with John 4/16 at 2pm &rarr; Parse in Fantastical**[^fantastical]

One of my favorite features is the ability to write emails in Markdown. For quick replies I still use Mail (and most replies are quick from my iPhone, anyway), but for longer-form messages, I'll open Drafts where I can include inline links and formatting using Markdown, then use the "Markdown: Email" feature to convert it and send as HTML email.

There are tons of actions supported for processing your input once you've entered it &mdash; Sending the text to email, Reminders, Messages, clipboard, printing, Dropbox &mdash; as well as the third-party app support. Things get really geeky once you dig into the customizable URL and Email actions.

This app is changing how I capture information from my iPhone, helping me strike a better balance between ubiquity of capture and the all-important correctness of processing. Highly recommended.

[^omnifocus-siri]: If you're an OF user and haven't tried the Siri integration, [check it out](https://vimeo.com/32334380).

[^fantastical]: This app has fantastic natural language processing for adding new items. So fast.
