[JekyllConf](https://jekyllconf.com/) is coming up in May, a conference to talk about the latest with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the static site generator that lets you publish websites without heavy needs for hosting and databases.

This isn't a typical conference, either. It's all online, streaming live via Google Hangouts on Air. Last year there were [great presentations](https://jekyllconf.com/2015/) from people worldwide on things they're doing with the framework.

We converted our [website](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/) some time back to use Jekyll for the entire thing. We started on Wordpress, which at the time made anything that wasn't a blog post annoying to deal with. Then we moved onto Wordpress just for the blog piece, with a [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)-based custom site for other static pages. For the last 3 years or so we've been 100% converted to a static site. Our Jekyll site is now thousands of files that generate the resulting pages, all hosted on GitHub, no web servers where we have to manage Apache or nginx configurations. We even have scripts that generate templates that then generate pages. Needless to say, it's powerful and changed the way we publish.

I also use it for this site. It's the only way I enjoy making webpages anymore.
