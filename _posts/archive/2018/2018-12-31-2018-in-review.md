2018 was a good year, both personally and professionally. Rather than a long-winded post about everything that happened, here’s a brief summary of accomplishments, major events, family stuff, and travel.

### Personal

* Read [43 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/11264786 "Books from 2018"). Check out my favorites of 2018: [part 1]({{ site.url }}/post/books-of-2018-part-1/ "Books of 2018, Part 1"), [part 2]({{ site.url }}/post/books-of-2018-part-2/ "Books of 2018, Part 2").
* Traveled to [NYC]({{ site.url }}/post/new-york-city-geo2050/ "New York City for Geo2050"), San Francisco, Atlanta, Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Toronto, St. Augustine, and Boston.
* Ran 214 miles in 66 separate runs. _(This one is particularly special to me. Since I had two major abdominal surgeries in August and October 2017, with a 12” scar running down my belly, I’m glad I’ve been able to push and get back up to pre-surgery pace.)_
* Completed immunotherapy treatment in November. Clear scans mean I’m on “maintenance” for the foreseeable future, with scans every 3 months for now. Probably the best “accomplishment” of the year!
* Wrote a post per day here since October 4th. 88 days in a row.
* Began practicing mindfulness once a day. Going strong the last month and enjoying it.

### Family

* Everett [turned 1]({{ site.url }}/post/everett-1-point-0/ "Everett 1.0"), started crawling at 8 months, climbing at 10 months, walking at 11 months (yes, he was climbing ladders and stools before walking 🤷🏽‍♂️).
* Elyse turned 3, started school 3 days a week, and switched to a new school 5 days a week. She loves every second of it.
* Colette and I celebrated our 10th anniversary!

### Professional

* We reached over 1800 customers of Fulcrum. It’s been used by customers in [180 countries](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/2018-in-review/ "Year in Review 2018"). Zooming back to when we launched the platform in 2011, I never thought we’d achieve what we have so far (and it feels like we’re just getting it figured out).
* We brought on 33 new people — now up to 53, [across 11 states]({{ site.url }}/post/all-hands-2018/ "All Hands 2018").
* I wrote 7 posts on our blogs — my favorites: on the [benefits of SaaS](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/the-benefits-of-software-as-a-service/ "Benefits of SaaS"), [our DroneDeploy integration](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/using-drone-maps-in-the-field-with-dronedeploy/ "DroneDeploy Maps in Fulcrim"), and on [creating lookup tables](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/creating-lookup-tables-in-fulcrum/ "Lookup Tables in Fulcrum") with Fulcrum.
* Late in the year I’ve been getting back into cartography. Hoping to keep that effort alive in 2019.
