As always during trips to Jacksonville, I made a visit to [Chamblin Bookmine](http://chamblinbookmine.com/default.aspx "Chamblin Bookmine"), my favorite bookstore. I never have enough time to browse, this time had about an hour before I had to be somewhere. So I had to act fast and hit all the sections looking for my target buys.

* Thomas Sowell – [A Conflict of Visions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3047 "Conflict of Visions")
* John Locke – [Two Treatises of Government](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/364550 "Two Treatises of Government")
* Will Durant – [The Story of Philosophy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31795 "The Story of Philosophy")
* Milton Friedman – [Free to Choose](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97820 "Free to Choose")
* F.A. Hayek – [The Road to Serfdom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/299215 "The Road to Serfdom")

A few of these I've read (Sowell and Effinger’s _Budayeen_ trilogy), but wanted to add them to the library for future re-reads.
