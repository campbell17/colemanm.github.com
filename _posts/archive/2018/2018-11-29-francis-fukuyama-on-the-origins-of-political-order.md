Francis Fukuyama's _[The Origins of Political Order]({{ site.url }}/books/fukuyama-the-origins-of-political-order/)_ was one of the most interesting books I've read in the last 5 years. It traces the history of human social hierarchy and government from antiquity to the French Revolution. This talk is a great high-level overview of the ground covered in the book. Think of it as a preview and convincing teaser to the full work.
