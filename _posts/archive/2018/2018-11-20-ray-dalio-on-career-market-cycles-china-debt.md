  title: "Ray Dalio on Market Cycles and China Debt"
---

A great long-form conversation with Ray Dalio on his experiences and thoughts on the current state of economic conditions and relationships. I'm in progress reading _[Principles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536546-principles)_, which I find interesting, but perhaps a bit overrated. Like many of the great economic thinkers in history, he's got an impressive perspective with a reasoned, objective, long-term view on what's happening. And his knowledge of history allows him to step back and look at current conditions through the lens of what's happened before. Turns out _most_ things that happen to the economy have happened many times before.
