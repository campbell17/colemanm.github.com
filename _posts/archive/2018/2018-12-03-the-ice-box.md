I'm not a huge follower of hockey anymore, but it's one of the most exciting sports you can watch live. I got a chance last week through [work](https://www.spatialnetworks.com/) to sit in the "Ice Box" at Amalie Arena for the Lightning vs. Sabres game. People always say sitting on the glass is a whole different experience, which it certainly is, but sitting between the benches adds another layer of intensity perhaps only equaled by courtside NBA seats.

Sitting on the Lightning bench side, there was less than a foot between me and Nikita Kucherov during the first period, separated only by glass.

There are only 8 seats in the arena like this, so it was a treat to get to do it.
