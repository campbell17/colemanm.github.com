The Premier League season is now a couple of months in, and the usual suspects are top of the table — City, Liverpool, Chelsea.

What I didn’t expect was Arsenal in the top four, especially after losing the first two weeks. Turns out new guy Unai Emery’s found his footing. 

Arsenal have put up 9 wins in a row (all competitions: league, Carabao, Europa League, FA Cup). There have been some skeptics with the new squad and management, but Emery is well on his way to silencing them. The next few weeks look winnable on the schedule. Leicester, Sporting, Palace, and Blackpool, then Liverpool to the Emirates. Emery’s done some experimenting with the starting XIs, but honestly everyone on the roster has been solid.
