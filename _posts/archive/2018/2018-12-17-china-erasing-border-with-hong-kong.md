{% include video.html id="MQyxG4vTyZ8" title="China is Erasing its Border with Hong Kong" %}

Part of Vox's _[Borders](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5cEIWi56dV_caS1M0i9Kgmb "Vox Borders")_ video series. Hong Kong is such a fascinating and unique place, as is today's China, though for massively different reasons. How China treats HK will be one of the indicators of the wider Chinese plan for free market economics and political openness.
