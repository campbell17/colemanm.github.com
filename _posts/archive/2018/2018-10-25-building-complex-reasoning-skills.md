The Khan Academy's [Long-term Research](https://www.khanacademy.org/research "Khan Academy Long Term Research") group studies new strategies for teaching and learning. This paper presents a method for freeform response and feedback on open-ended  The dynamism and interactivity of these tools for teaching are fantastic. I haven't seen some of these modern e-learning platforms in a long time, things like Blackboard or Canvas. I have used Khan Academy extensively and am always impressed. My childhood self would've really taken to the engaging presentation style of the content.

> Students shouldn’t have to wait until their adulthood to pursue open-ended problems and improve their ideas through discourse with others. Indeed, as we’ve discussed, contemporary learning standards insist that students develop these skills earlier than ever. Skillfully-orchestrated classroom  activities can successfully build these practices, but teachers across the country have lamented to us about how challenging and time-consuming these sessions are to facilitate.

> What if online learning platforms could deliver rapid, reliable, and relevant feedback to students on complex open-ended activities, the way they already do on simpler multiple-choice exercises? What if these activities could facilitate thoughtful and energetic discourse between students and their differing ideas?

They have an interesting take on harnessing students' skills to teach one another, through methods like peer review and feedback. Putting teachers in a position of being a "facilitator" much of the time would allow them the space to more effectively focus on students that need more help.
