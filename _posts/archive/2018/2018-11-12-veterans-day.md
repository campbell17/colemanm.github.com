I’m blessed to work with a large group of veterans these days. I’m thankful for the service of all veterans for making that amazing sacrifice. It’s easy to get wrapped up in nonsense, shortsighted, heated politics — Twitter these days is nearly unbearable with its tribalistic bickering. It’s worth taking a moment to zoom out and see the bigger picture; to see how many out there are playing their part and putting skin in the game for something larger than themselves.

My Veterans Day was made even better thanks to some excellent news on the health front. I’m overdue for a post to document my health “adventures” of the last year and a half. Now that so much time has passed, I think it’s time to take a look back at that for some perspective. Maybe some time in the next couple weeks I’ll try to get something up here.

To all of our current and former service members: thank you.
