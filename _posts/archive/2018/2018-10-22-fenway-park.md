A few weeks back I had an opportunity to catch a game at [Fenway Park](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipMzaRoLQMAWuK7H_zWmr9CPDJRKLeNuvk-xlAXR "Fenway Park") for the first time. Thatâ€™s definitely a bucket list item checked off.

[Tim](https://twitter.com/tim_morrissey "Tim Morrissey") got tickets last minute, some great seats down past the bend on the third base side, beneath the Monster. It was a beautiful night, with Chris Sale on the mound against the Blue Jays.
