If you enjoy hearing stories from visionaries, listen to this talk that Gabe Newell (founder of [Valve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation)) gave at UT Austin:

In it he discusses economies within [Steam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software)), where Steam is headed as a central core of APIs for game publishing, and a good bit about how the company operates.

>"It seems fairly obvious that the Internet does a better job of organizing a bunch of individuals than General Motors or Sears does. Corporations [with hierarchies] tend to be pre-internet ways of organizing production."

I love to hear stories about really smart people doing work and making things. Gabe definitely fits into that category: He left Microsoft in their crazy lucrative years during the mid-90s to found a video game company with his own money, with a [flat structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation#Organizational_structure), and no job titles that now generates [hundreds of millions](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-09-27-nexon-and-ncsoft-reported-in-talks-to-buy-valve) in revenue.
