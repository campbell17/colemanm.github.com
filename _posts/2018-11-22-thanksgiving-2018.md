Things to be thankful for, 2018 edition:

* Good bill of health, finally
* A beautiful little guy [turning 1 yesterday]({{ site.url }}/post/everett-1-point-0/)
* A 3 year old that loves school, makes us laugh, loves us and her brother, and I’m proud of every day
* An amazing wife that I couldn’t have made it through the last year and a half without, no chance
* A family that’s been there for support all along the 2017/18 roller coaster
* A [phenomenal workplace](https://www.spatialnetworks.com) that provided the flexibility, respect, and space to value personal health and family over the day-to-day work

Happy Thanksgiving to everyone. :turkey:
