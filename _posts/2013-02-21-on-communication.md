Lately I've been interested in how people and businesses communicate ideas, whether in the context of work, project management, product marketing, education, and the like. Late in 2012 I read a book called _Made To Stick_, which I found absolutely fascinating. It really struck a nerve and got me thinking in depth about how we communicate, whether as individuals or companies.

I recently watched a talk given at Harvard Law School by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
