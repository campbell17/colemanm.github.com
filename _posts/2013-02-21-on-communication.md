Lately I've been interested in how people and businesses communicate ideas, in the contexts of work, project management, product marketing, education, and the like. Late in 2012 I read a book called _Made To Stick_, which I found absolutely fascinating. While that book is ostensibly about the communication of ideas in a marketing context, it struck a nerve and got me thinking in depth about how we communicate, whether as individuals or companies.

The premise of _Made to Stick_ is that the six core properties present in "sticky" ideas are _simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotion, and story_. The book makes a very compelling case, replete with examples to demonstrate the point. But what I'm interested in more than the stickiness of an idea is what makes some business communicators so effective, and others so ineffective.

Bad communicators tend to drop the ball on keeping their points _simple_ and _clear_. 

I recently watched a talk given at Harvard Law School by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
