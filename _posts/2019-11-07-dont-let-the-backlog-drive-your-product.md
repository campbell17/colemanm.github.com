  title: "Don’t Let the Backlog Drive Your Product"
---

As we’ve started to adopt a process similar to Basecamp’s, we’ve been revisiting how we think about “backlogs” — the list of ideas and various requests we _could_ work on in the product roadmap.

I liked this piece from Rich Ziade on the downsides of backlogs.

> The term “backlog” makes me anxious. It implies _being behind_. It also implies that what you’ve got today is an incomplete thing. _You need to get through that backlog_. It also implies–dangerously–that this is the true unrealized ideal for a product.

After working on a (now) successful product for almost 10 years, this one is familiar:

> When any piece of software makes it out into the world, inevitably feedback follows. The bigger the impact of the software, the louder and more varied the feedback. It’s actually a sign of success.
