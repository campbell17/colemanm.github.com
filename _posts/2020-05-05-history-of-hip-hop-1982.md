I delved back into the archives of these mixtapes from [The Rub](https://twitter.com/ItsTheRub "The Rub") put together, originally back in 2007. When these came out I downloaded the mp3s and for a bunch of them I actually edited them into individual tracks so I could get them on my iPod more easily. Still have them in the iTunes library after all these years.

This [one from 1982](http://www.itstherub.com/hip-hop-history-volume-4-1982/ "Hip-Hop History 1982") is particularly great, but the whole series is fantastic.
