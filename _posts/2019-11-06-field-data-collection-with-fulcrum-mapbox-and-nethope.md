I wrote this wrap-up summary of our hands-on workshop we did at the NetHope Summit in San Juan. It was a great joint session with Mikel from Mapbox and John from NetHope. I’d love to do more of these in the future. Hands-on sessions where we can get outside and see our stuff in action always teach you a lot about how your UX works in practice.

I got to see more of what [Kepler](https://kepler.gl/ "Kepler") can do, too — the open source GIS toolkit built by the Uber team. Pretty slick stuff.
