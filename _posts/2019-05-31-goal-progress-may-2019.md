For the second half of the month I got into a good rhythm with every-other-day running. I was even able to push almost 5 miles beyond the pace target to end the month. I started running with the kids again in the jogging stroller, which I haven't done really at all since Elyse was little (2015-16). It's good because it gets them out of the house, adds some cargo to push for additional workout, and gives Colette a nice break if I take them when I get home at the end of the day.

| Activity       | Progress     | Pace         | Goal         | Plus-Minus                       |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 211.61 miles | 206.85 miles | 500 miles    | <span class="green">+4.76</span> |
| **Meditation** | 1595 minutes | 1510 minutes | 3650 minutes | <span class="green">+85</span>   |
| **Reading**    | 22 books     | 18.62 books  | 50 books     | <span class="green">+3.38</span> |

I was able to do more of what I'd [talked about doing]({{ site.url }}/post/goal-progress-april-2019/ "Goal Progress: April") in previous months with more frequent, shorter runs rather than having to force the longer ones to stay on pace. Consistency is everything when working on a long-term goal like this. The last 8 sessions have been in the 3-4 mile range, which I feel works well right now â€” a good balance of exercise without taking too much time, so I can still squeeze them in [later in the evening]({{ site.url }}/post/night-running/ "Night Running").

With my reading I've got too many threads open at the moment. I'm bad about getting 5 or 6 books in progress simultaneously, so sometimes it takes me longer to finish them up. This month I read Matthew Walker's excellent _[Why We Sleep]({{ site.url }}/books/walker-why-we-sleep/ "Why We Sleep")_[^mattwalker], which is an excellent scientific deep-dive into how sleep works and all of the interplays between sleep quality and other health factors. I'm looking forward to writing up something longer about it here sometime in the next few weeks when I have time.

June has quite a bit lined up both personally and professionally, but I don't see anything in the way of plowing through on the goals all month.

[^mattwalker]: Check out the [3-part interview series]({{ site.url }}/post/matthew-walker-on-sleep/ "Matt Walker on Sleep") he did with Peter Attia for a good summary of much of his book's material.
