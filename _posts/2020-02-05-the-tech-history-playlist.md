As I've been reading more into the history of technology[^tech-books], specifically computers and the Internet, I'll go on side trails through Wikipedia or the wider 'net back to many of the source papers that were the seeds of certain innovations.

I'd read about the [IBM 700 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_700/7000_series "IBM 700 Series") of mainframes, reading Vannevar Bush's [seminal piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/ "As We May Think") on a "memex" device (precursor idea to hypertext), or digging into Claude Shannon's [original work](http://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf "A Mathematical Theory of Communication") on information theory.

The latest gold mine I've found is on YouTube. I created a "Tech History" playlist where I've been logging clips and documentaries on various bits of computer history. Click the icon top-right to see all the videos in the list.

[^tech-books]: Including _[The Soul of a New Machine](/books/kidder-the-soul-of-a-new-machine/ "The Soul of a New Machine")_, _[How the Internet Happened](/books/mccullough-how-the-internet-happened/ "How the Internet Happened")_, and currently _[The Dream Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/722412 "The Dream Machine")_.
