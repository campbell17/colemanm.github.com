Lately I've been interested in how people and businesses communicate ideas, in the contexts of work, project management, product marketing, education, and the like. Late in 2012 I read a book called _[Made To Stick](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69242.Made_to_Stick)_, a study on what constitutes sticky, viral ideas. While the book is ostensibly about the communication of ideas in a marketing context, it struck a nerve and got me thinking in depth about how we communicate in general, whether as individuals or companies.

The book postulates that "sticky" ideas have six core properties: they're _simple_, _unexpected_, _concrete_, _credible_, _emotional_, and they _tell a story_. There are dozens of great examples of ideas that have lasted for decades or centuries, things like urban legends, proverbs, and countless meme-like advertising campaigns. The book makes a very compelling case, replete with examples to demonstrate the point. But what I'm interested in more than viral nature of ideas is what makes some interpersonal communication so effective, and some so ineffective. Much of theory in the book is relevant to everyday communication, not just marketing.

Thinking about properties of stickiness in relation to every day interactions with people, the salient point to me is that bad communicators tend to struggle with simplicity and clarity.

I recently watched a talk given by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas at Harvard, and he nails what it means to communicate clearly, in his case when publishing [opinions of the court](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/opinions.aspx) (around 58:30).

The entire talk is fascinating, but this part stands out:

>"The genius is not to write a five cent idea in a ten dollar sentence, it's to put a ten dollar idea into a five cent sentence. That's beauty, that's editing, that's writing. The editing we do is for clarity and simplicity, without losing meaning and content. And without adding things. You don't see a lot of double entendres, you don't see wordplays or cuteness in the opinions. We're not there to win a literary award, we're there to write opinions that some busy person, or someone at their kitchen table can read and say 'I don't agree with a word he said, but I understand what he said.'"

This level of care and energy is missing from a lot of communication. Understanding who the audience is for a piece of information &mdash; employee, customer, boss, spouse, et cetera &mdash; and then tailoring the message so that it connects with them in a way that's comprehensible. If the message we want to convey is important enough that we want it to sink in (when is it not?), it takes more care and mindfulness to hone it to its fundamentals.

One of the stories in _Made to Stick_ involves the idea of the "[Curse of Knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)" as a contributor to disconnects between communicator and audience &mdash; meaning the conveyor of information (whether it's your boss, your client, or the Supreme Court) holds a body of knowledge about a subject that the recipient does not. Think of times when company leaders talk about bottom lines, synergies, or corporate strategy, terms with completely ambiguous meanings to a regular employee. If we remove the layers of abstraction and insert common everyday language, it might not sound as pretty, but people certainly get the point.

Take the book's example of JFK's [address to congress](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/We_choose_to_go_to_the_moon) in 1961 in which he made his famous call to put a man on the moon:

>"But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? ... We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard."

Few words, but tons of concreteness. There's no confusion about his intent, "we're going to the moon, and here's the deadline". The author provides a contrasting example of how an American big business CEO would probably put it:

>"Our mission is to become the international leader in the space industry through maximum team-centered innovation and strategically targeted aerospace initiatives."

That's absolutely something you would see on a Fortune 500 company website.

A quality I admire most in people is an ability to be articulate, to clearly express a point or intent in few words, and to get to the point quickly. Nothing is more frustrating to me than someone trying to tell you something and giving you the full history dump up front. In the journalism world they call it "burying the lede"; when the crux of the point or argument is placed farther into the story, and the writer favors auxiliary information first. Clever positioning of a message is fine in the context of a film or novel, but when conveying a message to have it acted upon, surrounding it with excess information distracts.
