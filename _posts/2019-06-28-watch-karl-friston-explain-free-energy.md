Neuroscientist [Karl Friston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston "Karl Friston") is the world's leading authority on brain imaging science and on the forefront of our understanding of how brains actually work. He's the creator of the [free energy principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle "Free energy principle"), an idea that attempts to unify an organizing framework for what drives all life: minimizing free energy.
