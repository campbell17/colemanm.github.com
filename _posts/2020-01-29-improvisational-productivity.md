I struggle with calendars and how to manage communicating "availability". Simply publishing your calendar or considering every unbooked space as "open" implies you're just waiting to have a meeting. In reality those tend to be the most productive times!

Daniel Gross communicates it well in this post on productivity:

> Time isnâ€™t the correct index for a schedule. Time doesn't know when I'll be in flow. White space in the calendar doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™ll be sitting at my desk, twiddling my thumbs, just waiting for someone to call. It usually means Iâ€™ll be working. When I mis-fire and schedule a meeting for when Iâ€™m in flow, it can cost me double the meeting time. Breaking the feedback loop of flow with a meeting, notification, or anything else should be illegal. And time-based scheduling often causes it.
