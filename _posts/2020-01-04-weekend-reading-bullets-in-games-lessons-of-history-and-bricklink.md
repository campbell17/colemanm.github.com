### [How Do Bullets Work in Video Games?](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TristanJung/20191206/355250/How_Do_Bullets_Work_in_Video_Games.php "How Do Bullets Work in Video Games?")

A cool analysis of methods for rendering bullet physics in games.

### [Notes on "The Lessons of History"](http://maksim.ms/blog/book/2016/lessons-of-history/ "Notes on The Lessons of History")

Maksim Stepanenko's notes on Will and Ariel Durant's _[The Lessons of History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History "The Lessons of History")_. I've got this one on the shelf, and these nuggets make me want to pick it up now to read.

### [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/main.page "BrickLink")

While working on some Lego sets with the kids, I wanted to know if some extra parts we had were from the sets they got, since everything had gotten mixed up. Since it'd been years since I had any Legos, I thought there might be databases out there to lookup parts by number. Lo-and-behold I found this one where you can input an [individual part ID](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3795&idColor=34#T=C&C=34 "BrickLink part"), and also find out what [other sets](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=41188-1#T=S "BrickLink set") contain the same part. A tool that I would've eaten up as a kid cataloging our Legos and searching for "custom" parts.
