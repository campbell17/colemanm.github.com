---

This is a great narrative story from the Wall Street Journal about the current situation in California with PG&E, the rolling blackouts, and the wildfires ravaging the state. Drone video, maps, data on fire risk and infrastructure paint a pretty grim picture of the problem. It’ll take years for PG&E to catch up to where there’s anything resembling a long-term solution to this problem.
