### 🚙 [How Self-Driving Cars Could Communicate with You](https://medium.com/self-driven/how-self-driving-cars-could-communicate-with-you-in-the-future-e814d276937f "How Self-Driving Cars Could Communicate with You")

Interesting work by Ford’s self-driving team on how robotic vehicles could signal intent to pedestrians. You normally think Waymo, Tesla, and Uber with AV tech. But Ford’s [investment in Argo](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16155254/argo-ai-ford-self-driving-car-autonomous "Ford + Argo") and [GM with Cruise](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/gms-cruise-gets-2-25b-from-softbanks-vision-fund-1-1b-from-gm/ "Cruise Automation") demonstrates they're serious.

### 📲 [The iPad Pro is a Computer](https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/10/brooklyn-event-impressions-the-ipad-pro-is-a-computer/ "iPad Pro Event")

Jason Snell’s thoughts on the new iPad Pro release last week:

> I love the new design of the iPad Pro models. The flat back with the flat sides, which remind me of the original iPad design and the iPhone 4/5/SE, is a delight. But when you pick one up, the first thing you notice is that the bezels are even all the way around—and they’re almost, but not quite, gone entirely

An improved keyboard case, new revision to the Pencil, reduced bezel width, and Face ID support are all the right updates to make to get me closer to the goal of iPad Pro over laptop. The Folio idea for the case sounds fantastic, and with the Pencil, it's amazing how innovative it can seem to add a small flat segment to keep it from rolling off the table.

Buffer’s [Joel Gascoigne](https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne "Joel Gascoigne") with an in-depth overview of how they bought out their Series A investors to reset. Their _[Open](https://open.buffer.com/ "Buffer Open")_ blog series is worth a follow. They openly publish all sorts of insider details on running and growing a startup that are insightful for comparison.
