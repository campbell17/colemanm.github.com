My talk from Ignite Spatial at [WhereCampTB](http://www.wherecamptb.org), talking about the [OSM Tampa Bay](http://www.osmtampabay.org) meetup group. Check out the slides in better detail [here](http://speakerdeck.com/u/colemanm/p/osm-tampa-bay).

It was a fun event a couple weeks ago &mdash; great participation from folks in all sorts of industries involved in mapping or using GIS tools.
