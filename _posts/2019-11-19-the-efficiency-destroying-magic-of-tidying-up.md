A thought-provoking post from [Florent Crivello](https://twitter.com/Altimor "Florent Crivello"). Engineersâ€™ continuously seek structure and organization assuming that itâ€™s a proxy for efficiency. Here the author points out that with new tools enabling AI systems to design the most efficient way to construct things, you donâ€™t get anything remotely like what a human would generate.

Bottoms-up systems like organically-spreading cities, evolved species, weather patterns, and the like donâ€™t naturally form looking like an urban plannerâ€™s dream â€” theyâ€™re much messier (but often the most efficient).

> Planners may make their maps look better when they use zoning to separate the city into business, residential, and commercial neighborhoods, but they also destroy a subtle, efficient balance. They forget that the only activity that goes on in any city is that of people living their lives, which requires all the activities above â€” preferably in close proximity. Splitting a city into residential, commercial and business zones is like throwing dough, cheese and pepperoni into the different compartments of a bento box and calling it a pizza.
