[An unbreakable record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Earnshaw):

>He is the only player to have scored a hat-trick in the English Premier League, Championship, League One, League Two (or the divisions under their previous names), the League Cup, the FA Cup and for his country at International level.
