We've just posted a [map of Kabul](http://tiles.mapbox.com/spatialnetworks/map/Kabul#15.00/34.5216/69.1743), Afghanistan built from [spatial networks](http://spatialnetworks.com) map data. I built this a couple of months back (with [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill)) for some mobile field collection project work we were doing with [Fulcrum](http://fulcrumapp.com/). This is the sort of challenging work that our company is out there doing, bringing high-tech (yet cheap and simple) solutions to up-and-coming communities like Kabul.
