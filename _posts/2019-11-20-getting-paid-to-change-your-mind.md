Thereâ€™s a really strange phenomenon in certain arenas (particularly politics) where itâ€™s considered a virtue to strongly hold a viewpoint and never change your position. This is strange because, as Rory Sutherland points out here, if you did this in business youâ€™d likely run into frictions that put you out of business. Changing your mind is an imperative when presented with new data.

> And herein lies one magic quality of business. It is the only area of human activity where you get paid to change your mind.

> In politics, in punditry, in academia, there is great value attached to consistency. Changing your mind risks loss of face. Your ability to deliver plausible generalisations counts for a lot. There is social pressure to adopt the dominant frame of thought. No one gets invited on Newsnight to say â€˜Iâ€™m not really sureâ€™ and â€˜Itâ€™s kind of complicatedâ€™.

Itâ€™s like starting out on a journey with a road map in front of you, encountering unforeseen obstacles (road closures or standstill traffic), and never wavering from the original plan. We should be better about being open-minded about political figures being honest about adapting views. Nothing thatâ€™s fixed ever improves â€” itâ€™s best case scenario is stasis.
