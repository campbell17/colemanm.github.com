We had our two family Thanksgivings today, which makes for a hectic but enjoyable day with most of the families. The kids can really go hard on days like this — no idea how they last so long. 

Here’s the shortlist of gratitudes for 2019:

* A strong outlook on the [health front](/post/moving-to-three-months/ "Moving to Three Months")
* [Elyse at 4](/post/elyse-4-point-0/ "Elyse 4.0") in pre-K and Everett just [hitting the 2 mark](/post/everett-2-point-0/ "Everett 2.0")
* Colette and all she does for us (and puts up with us)
* Continued progress and growth in [our product](https://www.fulcrumapp.com "Fulcrum")
* The ability to have the space and commitment to work on hitting personal goals for the year

Happy Thanksgiving!
