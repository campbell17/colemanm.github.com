An interesting idea for looking at data. Rather than the typical negative, dour news you read daily, this site presents data demonstrating positive progress.

{% include image.html file="beautiful-news.jpg" description="Beautiful News" caption="no" %}

Examples:

* [US Cancer Survival Rates are Rising](https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/150-us-cancer-deaths/ "US Cancer Survival Rates are Rising")
* [African Countries are Squashing Malaria](https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/1172-africa-squashing-malaria/ "African Countries are Squashing Malaria")
* [Smoking is Falling Fast in Japan](https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/49-japan-smoking/ "Smoking is Falling Fast in Japan")
* [We've Almost Eradicated Polio](https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/48-almost-eliminated-polio/ "We've Almost Eradicated Polio")

It's surprising that it's not more common to pay attention to where we're making progress. More on this theme about progress studies [here](/post/progress-studies/ "Progress Studies"). Also check out Hans Rosling's _[Factfulness](/books/rosling-factfulness/ "Factfulness")_ for a great primer on the subject of data-driven appreciation of human advancements.
