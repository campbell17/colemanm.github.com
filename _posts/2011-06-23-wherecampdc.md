We attended the first [WhereCampDC](http://www.wherecampdc.org/) a couple weeks ago, and I wrote up [my summary](http://spatialnetworks.com/blog/2011/06/wherecampdc-wrap-up-the-geoherd-gathers/) on our blog.

The first night at National Geographic was a fantastic Ignite session, with the unconference on Saturday at Washington Post's headquarters. An exciting event, to be sure, and can't wait for the next one.
