The kids had a great holiday â€” a beach day with their cousins, lunch on the beach together, then an evening playtime slash barbecue over at a friend's house for dinner. It was the first beach trip here at home since probably Fathers Day of last year. We need to do it more often on the tail end of the summer.

I even got a [5-mile run](https://www.strava.com/activities/2674433928 "Run after beach") in while everyone was napping and relaxing after the beach trip.
