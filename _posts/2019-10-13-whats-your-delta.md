On comparing yourself to others:

> We all have a story we tell ourselves about ourselves.  You have one.  I have one.  And this story is what we use to judge our successes and our failures.  But it’s not the only story that could have been written, it’s just the one that was written.  If your story has more blessings than hardships, consider lending a hand to someone who wasn’t as fortunate.  The power of having a positive delta is being able to uplift those currently experiencing a negative delta.
