Martin Gurri in response to Marc Andreessen's "It's Time to Build" essay:

> So how do we get from _here_ to _build_? To demand that our current institutions make that leap would be like asking the Great Pyramid to win the Indianapolis 500. It won’t happen. As a precursor to Andreessen’s building spree, our institutions—certainly government at every level, including the regulatory and scientific agencies—must crack open their industrial-age cocoons and join the rest of us in the digital dispensation. At a minimum, they must be able to move as fast as information does today. This will require different protocols, different technology, a different form: less like the Great Pyramid and more like a race car. They must be flatter and faster.

For more on the problematic status of our institutions, Gurri's _[The Revolt of the Public](/books/gurri-the-revolt-of-the-public/ "The Revolt of the Public")_ was fantastic. And I just finished Yuval Levin's _[A Time to Build](/books/levin-a-time-to-build/ "A Time to Build")_, where he presents a clear diagnosis of some of those problems and an optimistic case for improving things.
