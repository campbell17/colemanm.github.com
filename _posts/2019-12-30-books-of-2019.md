I just finished my last book I'll complete this year, making the final tally 54.

Here's the full list of [everything I read](/books/ "Books"):

{% assign books = site.books | sort: 'date_completed' %}
{% assign start = '2019-01-01' | date: '%Y-%m-%d' %}
{% assign end = '2019-12-31' | date: '%Y-%m-%d' %}
{% for book in books %}
{% assign completed = book.date_completed | date: '%Y-%m-%d' %}
{% if completed >= start and completed <= end %}
* [{{ book.title }}](/books/{{ book.slug }}/ "{{ book.title }}"), {{ book.author }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

My [library](/books/ "Books") page has links to each book, including the occasional review.
