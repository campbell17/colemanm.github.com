### üéõ [Geocomputation with R](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) 

I‚Äôve had R on my list for a long time to dig deeper with. A while back I set myself up with RStudio and went through some [DataCamp]() stuff. This online book seems like excellent material in how to apply R to geostatistics.

Given where we are with [Fulcrum](https://www.fulcrumapp.com) in the product lifecycle, this rang very familiar on the struggles with how to listen to customers effectively, who to listen to, and how to absorb or deflect ideas. Once you get past product-market fit, the same tight connection between your customers and product team becomes impossible. Glad to hear we aren‚Äôt alone in our struggles here.

This piece from David Heinemeier Hansson is a good reminder that steady, linear growth is still great performance for a business. Every business puts itself in a different situation, and certainly many are in debt or investment positions that linear growth isn‚Äôt good enough for. Even so, consistent growth in the positive direction should always be commended.
