  title: "Clip Sharing with Overcast"

Marco Arment just shipped a new update to [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/ "Overcast") (the best iOS podcast app) with an [awesome new feature](https://marco.org/2019/04/27/overcast-clip-sharing "Overcast clip sharing") that allows you to clip sections to share. Since its early days you've been able to share a podcast episode with an anchor link to a timestamp, but this new clip sharing ability is a major improvement that should make podcast content easier to point people to and recommend.

This doesn't just allow you to create a clip to share, it even generates a nice embeddable video (landscape, square, or portrait) for posting through social channels.

Many times I've wanted to clip segments just to save for myself. This should be super useful for archiving interesting conversations.
