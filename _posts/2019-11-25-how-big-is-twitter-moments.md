  title: "How Big is Twitter Moments?"
---

A post from Balaji Srinivasan from a couple years back on Twitter Moments. He had some interesting points on the likely traffic and comps to other news outlets. Twitter is still _huge_ in the timely news space. I liked this point on the opportunity here (especially for Twitter, which has done little with the platform for 5+ years):

> Whenever we see a technology with empirical traction whose importance is neglected or even derided, it’s a useful signal of an investment or entrepreneurship opportunity. Good examples that I’ve been personally involved with include Soylent and Bitcoin, where skepticism, mockery, and outright hostility was eventually followed by huge returns for those who bet against the crowd.
