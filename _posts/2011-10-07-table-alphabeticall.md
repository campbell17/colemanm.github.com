>Gentle reader, thou must learne the Alphabet, to wit, the order of the Letters as they stand, perfectly without booke, and where every Letter standeth: as _b_ neere the beginning, _n_ about the middest, and _t_ toward the end. Nowe if the word, which thou art desirous to finde, begin with _a_ then looke in the beginning of this Table, but if with _v_ looke towards the end. Againe, if thy word beginne with _ca_ looke in the beginning of the letter _c_ but if with _cu_ then looke toward the end of that letter. And so of all the rest. &amp;c.
