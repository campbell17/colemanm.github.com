After recently finishing _[The Tangled Tree]({{ site.url }}/books/quammen-the-tangled-tree/ "The Tangled Tree")_, I was reading about the different [domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(biology) "Domain (biology)") of the tree of life. Somehow I landed on this work by Ernst Haeckel. Amazing art and even more incredible that nature has produced this diversity by mixing chance and time.
