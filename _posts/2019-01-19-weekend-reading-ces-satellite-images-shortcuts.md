### üì± [CES 2019: A Show Report](https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/ces-85ca9f07c08a "CES 2019 Show Report")

This year‚Äôs excellent report from the show floor from Steven Sinofsky. It's extensive and covers the products a-to-z, breaking down the trends by category. I'd also recommend the [companion podcast](https://a16z.com/2019/01/16/consumer-electronics-trends-ces-2019/ "a16z podcast on CES") conversation between Sinofsky and Benedict Evans.

### üó∫ [Satellite Image Guide for Journalists and Media](https://pierre-markuse.net/2018/12/18/satellite-image-guide-for-journalists-and-media/ "Satellite Image Guide for Journalists and Media")

A helpful guide with tips and factoids on satellite imagery. Includes a primer on the various sensor platforms, differences in resolution, color correction, infrared, and more. There are also a ton of reference links for data and other things.
