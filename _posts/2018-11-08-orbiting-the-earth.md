If you've got an Apple TV and used their "Aerial" screensavers, this'll look familiar. Most of those ones are drone footage or other things close to the ground, but recently they've got a couple done from space. This one is even better, though. It's mesmerizing to see how small everything looks from this perspective, with no borders or "human" landscapes. Just the Earth and its natural chaos and beauty.

Jason Kottke has a number of [other similar videos](https://kottke.org/18/11/hours-and-hours-of-relaxing-meditative-videos) of meditative scenes like [10 hours of island sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QPbriKs_sI), an [Arctic icebreaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpW7iYfuGDU), and a live feed from the [front of a frieght train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTpDWzfRMg8).
