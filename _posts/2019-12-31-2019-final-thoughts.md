Since I already wrote up my [overview of 2019](/post/goal-summary-wrapping-up-2019/ "Goal Summary: Wrapping Up 2019") a couple weeks ago, here are some final notes to close out the year.

* I continued the practice of [posting here every day](/post/the-every-day-blog/ "The Every Day Blog") this year. I've been enjoying it as a means to keep me focused on learning and writing. No intention on stopping!
* Worked on some major evolutionary changes to [the business](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/ "Fulcrum") that'll start bearing fruit in 2020.
* Didn't do as much traveling as previous years. Notable trips to [San Jose](/post/san-jose/ "San Jose"), [San Diego](/post/san-diego-april-2019/ "San Diego"), and [Puerto Rico](/post/san-juan/ "San Juan").

On to a new decade!
