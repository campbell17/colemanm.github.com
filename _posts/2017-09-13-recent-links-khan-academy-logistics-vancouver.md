Fascinating work by the Khan Academy research team. They’re exploring different types of tools for teaching using visible, tangible “toys” to visualize concepts like fractions, subtraction, and more with interactive models.

### 🚢 [How Logistics Networks Respond to Natural Disasters](https://www.flexport.com/blog/hurricane-harvey-whats-next-us-importers/)

I just finished up reading [The Box](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30111234-the-box), a history of how container shipping came about and evolved the global economy. With the storms of the last few weeks, I always wonder what sorts of second- and third-order impacts there are around the world when supply chains are disrupted by natural events.

### 🇨🇦 [The Wild West Coast of Vancouver Island](http://www.cruisingworld.com/wild-west-coast-vancouver-island)

I enjoyed this piece in Cruising World about a family’s sailing trip down the west side of Vancouver Island. The wild, wooded, and rocky coast of British Columbia is amazing landscape. They took this trip with their daughters of 2 and 5. What an amazing experience for kids to see wild bears and the village outposts in those harbors.
