I still bring out Explosions in the Sky's 2003 album *[The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Earth_Is_Not_a_Cold_Dead_Place "The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place")* periodically, my favorite from their catalog by a wide margin. I remember seeing them at a live show for the first time on the tour for this album, probably 2004, where they played this song somewhere in the set. In their shows I've seen in successive years, it's one of their encore numbers.

The 6 or 7 crescendos and the build-up to the peak (around the 9 minute mark in this clip) are incredible. The sheer volume of sound that comes out of a few guys with guitars.
