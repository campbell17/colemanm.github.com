Tyler Cowen is one of the most prolific people out there. His batting average on producing high-quality content is unreal. Just following his blog, podcast, and Twitter makes one wonder how he also has time for so much reading, teaching, and any other life activity.

A few good ones from the list:

> Much of my writing time is devoted to laying out points of view which are not my own.  I recommend this for most of you.
>
> I do serious reading every day.
>
> Every day I ask myself “what did I learn today?”, a question I picked up from Amihai Glazer.  I feel bad if I don’t have a clear answer, while recognizing the days without a clear answer are often the days where I am learning the most (at least in the equilibrium where I am asking myself this question).
