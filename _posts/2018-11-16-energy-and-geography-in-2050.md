Another great Geography2050 is in the books. This year’s focus was on energy, and as you might expect much of the panel discussion and subject matter expertise was on renewable energy sources and climate change response issues. It’s a topic I follow loosely, but I learned a lot about the diversity of organizations working on the problem and heard a number of interesting new ideas.

One of the best panel discussions was on energy consumption and economic growth in China — nearly an hour and a half discussion on how China got where it is today, and what the political atmosphere is like around addressing renewable energy issues.

The whole AGS crew, the Council, and all of the sponsors did a phenomenal job bringing it all together (as usual!).

Next year’s focus topic will be [on borders](http://2019.geography2050.org "Geo2050 2019") — that one should yield some fantastic discussion.
