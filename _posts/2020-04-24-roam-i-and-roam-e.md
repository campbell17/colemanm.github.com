A neat concept demo from Dhrumil Shah showing possible enhancements for Roam Research. He calls them "Roam-I" and "Roam-E":

* **Roam-I** — for reusing old knowledge
* **Roam-E** — collaboration

Most of this is user interface on top of the core technology that underpins how Roam works, but it's great to see people so passionate about this that they'll spend this much time prototyping ideas on products they use.
