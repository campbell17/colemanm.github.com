A [great article from UXMAG](http://uxmag.com/articles/why-we-need-storytellers-at-the-heart-of-product-development) making the case for "product storytellers" on product teams, instead of more marketing or product management. A must-read for creators trying to bring products to market. This statement gets to the heart of the problem with struggling products &mdash; **the _what_ and _how_ of the product get put above the _why_**:

>The root cause of these symptoms is the fact that execution focuses on the how and what of a product. But in a world where consumers are inundated with choices, products that want to be noticed and adopted must be rooted in the why.

>A product is more than an idea, it's more than a website, and it's more than a transaction or list of functionalities. A product should provide an experience or service that adds value to someone's life through fulfilling a need or satisfying a desire. The ultimate question then becomes: who identifies that value? After the executive or stakeholder identifies the initial idea, who in the organization ensures that the product and experience deliver value to the user? Maybe it isn't the product manager, marketer, technologist, or designer; perhaps what we need is a new role: the product storyteller.
