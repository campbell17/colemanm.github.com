Our design and marketing team put together this awesome shop for company-branded gear — some shirts, mugs, and other swag with product brands and other [fun](https://spatialnetworks.myshopify.com/collections/apparel/products/null-island-t-shirt "Null Island Shirt") [stuff](https://spatialnetworks.myshopify.com/collections/apparel/products/cubicle-body-t-shirt "Cubicle Body Shirt") (I even got [my own tribute](https://spatialnetworks.myshopify.com/collections/apparel/products/coleman-doesnt-know-t-shirt "Coleman Shirt")). I'll have to say that my personal favorite has to be [Caleb](https://twitter.com/cfsanderson)'s custom [Joy Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures "Unknown Pleasures") [homage](https://spatialnetworks.myshopify.com/collections/apparel/products/joy-division-t-shirt "Joy Division Shirt"):

Of course we're not in the business of using this as a money-making venture. All of the proceeds from anything purchased here are going to an organization called [Stop Soldier Suicide](https://stopsoldiersuicide.org/ "Stop Soldier Suicide"), co-founded by our friend Nick Black. As should be more widely known, veterans returning home from deployments often struggle with the process of reintegrating into "normal" civilian life. SSS was founded in 2010 to help stop this terrible problem for veterans and their families. Here's more about SSS from their website:

> With more than 45,000 veteran service organizations recognized by the IRS, getting help can be difficult, confusing, and time-consuming. We’re here to change that. Stop Soldier Suicide works 1-on-1 with troops, veterans, and military family members to help navigate the maze of services, programs, and assistance available.
