### ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡· [The Shadow Commander](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-shadow-commander "The Shadow Commander")

This 2013 piece from Dexter Filkins gives an excellent background on Qasem Soleimani, an important figure now well known after his killing a couple of weeks ago, but prior to that hardly known by anyone other than experts, even with his massive influence in the region.

### ðŸŒŒ [Prosperous Universe](https://www.pcgamer.com/this-deep-simulation-of-space-economics-is-surprisingly-compelling/ "Prosperous Universe")

I'm always intrigued by complicated simulation games. I remember a few of these "real-time" MMO games being popular in the early days of online gaming. Glad to see the genre still kicking in an era of low-attention-span gaming largely taking over. From the [Prosperous Universe](https://prosperousuniverse.com/about/ "Prosperous Universe") website:

> At the heart of our vision lies the concept of a closed economic loop. There have been thousands of browser-based sci-fi strategy games before that emphasize military conflict. By contrast, Prosperous Universe is all about the economy and complex player-driven supply chains in which every material has to be either produced or purchased from other player-run companies.

### ðŸ”— [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/ "Roam Research")

Roam is an interesting note-taking tool that's like a hybrid graph database and wiki. I tinkered with it a little bit. Seems attractive as a way to take meeting notes to try it out.
