I saw this *Nightline* interview clip with Steve Jobs from a recent [Steven Sinofsky post](https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/bicycle-121262546097 "Bicycle for the Mind"). 

{% include video.html id="3H-Y-D3-j-M" %}

In this clip is his famous "bicycle for the mind" quote about the personal computer.

> This is a 21st century bicycle that amplifies a certain intellectual ability that man has. And I think that after this process has come to maturity, the effects that it's going to have on society are going to far outstrip even those of the petrochemical revolution has had.

Hard to believe Jobs was this prescient at age 26, when computers were still considered to be hobbyist toys.
