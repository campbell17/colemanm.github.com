  title: "Matthew Walker Podcast on Sleep"
---

This is an excellent 3-part interview with Dr. Matthew Walker on Peter Attia's podcast. Walker is a sleep scientist and professor of neuroscience, and this series with him dives extremely deep on sleep â€” sleep stages, effects on cancer, heart disease, metabolism, and how things like caffiene negatively impact sleep patterns. I've been bad lately about focusing on a good sleep schedule and need to get reset on a committed pattern to put in the 8 hours a night. I've been too frequently at 6 or less hours a night which I _know_ isn't healthy, but since I can still function on low sleep I make excuses that it's okay. Dr. Walker's points hit home and make a convincing case to make sure you get good, healthy sleep.
