In the fall of 2012, we launched [Pushpin](http://pushpinosm.org/), a mobile OpenStreetMap editor for iOS. Itâ€™s now been used by thousands of people in over 100 countries for casual editing, mapping parties, and humanitarian aid projects. Pushpin has lowered lower the bar for mappers, making it simpler for newcomers to make meaningful contributions. This talk reviewed some of the experiences of Pushpin's development, statistics on its usage worldwide, and how Spatial Networks wants to grow the app in the coming year.
