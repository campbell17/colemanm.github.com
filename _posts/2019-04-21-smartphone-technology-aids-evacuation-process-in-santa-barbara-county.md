We've been supporting the Santa Barbara County Sheriff through Fulcrum Community this year for evacuation reporting during emergency preparation and response. It feels great to have technology that can have real-world immediate impact like this. The gist of their workflow (right now) is using the app to log where evacuation orders were posted, where they haven't notified yet, and tracking that with the slim resources available even in time of need. Centralizing the reporting has made a big difference:

> All of this information is uploaded in real time and is accessible to incident commanders who can follow the progress as an evacuation order is implemented.
>
> “It’s really sped up the process, and given us more accurate information,” said Nelson Trichler, an incident commander for the sheriff’s Search and Rescue Team. “It’s a tool we can go back to statistically to see who is responding to these evacuations.
