Donayle put together this summary of what we've accomplished this year through our Fulcrum Community initiative. Some great stuff here:

> During [Cyclones Idai](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/team-rubicon-mozambique/) and Kenneth, [Team Rubicon](https://teamrubiconusa.org/)â€™s Medic team went to Mozambique with Fulcrum in hand and served over 1,000 injured during those cyclonic episodes, using our tools to document and communicate those injuries to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/).
>
> Our [NetHope](https://nethope.org/2019/12/18/on-being-thankful-and-hopeful-for-2020/) partners responded to the Colombia-Venezuela border crisis with internet connectivity and communications support, restoring communication for thousands of displaced families while using Fulcrum to share installation information.
>
> Instead of fireworks, an earthquake shook Searles Valley, California on the Fourth of July, and [Earthquake Engineering Research Institute](https://www.eeri.org/) (EERI) was there, conducting damage assessments and reporting dangerous conditions to first responders using Fulcrum.
