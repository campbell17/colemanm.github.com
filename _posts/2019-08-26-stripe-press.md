I found out recently, I think through an [EconTalk interview](http://www.econtalk.org/tyler-cowen-on-big-business/ "Tyler Cowen on EconTalk") with economist Tyler Cowen, that Stripe has created [their own publishing house](https://press.stripe.com/ "Stripe Press") for books. From their own about page:

> Stripe Press highlights ideas that we think can be broadly useful. Some books contain entirely new material, some are collections of existing work reimagined, and others are republications of previous works that have remained relevant over time or have renewed relevance today.

I love this idea. It's fantastic to see a company really putting skin in the game on advancing ideas core to their philosophy. Specifically they've dredged up M. Mitchell Waldrop's *[The Dream Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop/dp/1732265119/ "The Dream Machine")* from being out of print and are republishing it. They also look like beautiful hardcover versions of these classics.
