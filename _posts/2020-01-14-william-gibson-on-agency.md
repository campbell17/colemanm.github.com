A fun piece on William Gibson's latest work of speculative fiction, _Agency_. I've read a bunch of his bibliography, but my favorites (in order) are still _Neuromancer_ and its sequel, _Count Zero_.

Here's an interesting bit of history on writing _Neuromancer_:

> "I was actually able to write Neuromancer because I didnâ€™t know anything about computers," he says. "I knew literally nothing. What I did was deconstruct the poetics of the language of people who were already working in the field. Iâ€™d stand in the hotel bar at the Seattle science fiction convention listening to these guys who were the first computer programmers I ever saw talk about their work. I had no idea what they were talking about, but that was the first time that I ever heard the word â€˜interfaceâ€™ used as a verb. And I swooned. Wow, thatâ€™s a verb. Seriously, poetically that was wonderful."
