The latest episode of [Debug](http://www.imore.com/debug) had a great discussion with Don Melton and Jim Ray on Safari's development, web standards, and the state of web advertising.

The link jumps right to the discussion of ads and the ethics of content blocking in current publishing landscape. Rene Ritchie has some interesting thoughts on the subject and wrote [a piece on iMore](http://www.imore.com/content-blockers-bad-ads-and-what-were-doing-about-it) about it. Ads, Javascript embeds, and trackers are toeing the line on privacy (if not crossing it), but more simply than that, they're making the Internet slower and more obnoxious to use. Ad networks, however scummy, _are_ keeping the sites we like afloat.
