Since late last year I've been keeping up with practicing every day. Mostly 10 minute sessions, but recently I've been upping that to 15.

One important thing I need to work in is how to fit it more consistently into the schedule. I don't have a set time when I practice; sometimes its before work in the morning, but sometimes also late at night (when falling asleep is a hard competitor). Comfort level is rising with each session. Mindfulness doesn't feel natural, so the repetition at least makes that part go away a bit.

With the breath focus I'm having the common struggle of mind-wandering while trying to focus attention on breathing. I picked up a book called _[The Mind Illuminated](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25942786-the-mind-illuminated "The Mind Illuminated")_ which I've heard great things about as a guide to all phases of the process, but especially to help break through this particular early hurdle.
