It’s been busy around our house the last couple of days.

Hung up some Christmas lights:

We have some chickens for the week while our friends (their owners) are out of town:

Saw _Frozen II_ and had dinner with some friends:

Still have a get together here at the house, a couple of Thanksgivings, a holiday parade, and I’m sure plenty more!
