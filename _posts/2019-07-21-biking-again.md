Last weekend I got the bike back up and running again. It’s been out of commission in the garage since the move a few months ago. Just had to clean it up a bit and put some air in the tires and it’s good to go. I’ve got a budding plan to start commuting down to the office, thinking I’ll start with a target of doing that two times per week to start. It’s about a 6 mile ride each way, which wouldn’t take much longer than driving, but in the summer heat here it’s plenty to require a shower when I get there. With the unpredictable weather here in the summer, committing myself to more than a couple commutes per week will just mean I’ll come up short on the goal.

My bike is only a single speed (a [Takara Kabuto](https://roadbike.io/takara-kabuto-single-speed-road-bike-review/ "Takara Kabuto road bike") with no bells and whistles. It’s been reliable over the 7 or so years I’ve had it — no problems at all but tire replacement. I’m exploring getting a more serious road bike at some point, but I’ve told myself that’s not allowed until I can build up a good pattern of regular usage on the one I’ve got.

I went out for [a loop ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/2548937981 "Climbing the Col du Shore Acres") yesterday and it felt good. My regular running has got my cardio up to make a decent pace ride pretty easy.
