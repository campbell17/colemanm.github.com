Every year [we](https://www.spatialnetworks.com "Spatial Networks") make the trek to New York City for the annual [Geography 2050](http://www.geography2050.org "Geo 2050") conference, the pillar event organized and hosted by the [American Geographical Society](http://www.americangeo.org "American Geographical Society"). We’re staying in Times Square and the event is uptown at Columbia University, with day 2 hosted at the incredible Low Memorial Library.

After a nice 2 hour delay this morning I finally made it into town. Picked a good seat with the approach into LaGuardia past lower Manhattan. This is always a window seat flight for me, with the chance to get a good view of the City from above (weather and luck-of-the-draw permitting).

It’s going to be a chilly week up here, with weather getting down into the 30s over the next couple of days. We’ll be close enough to the lower end of Central Park that I’ve got a couple of runs planned. Going to have to do pick up the pace if I want to stay warm.
