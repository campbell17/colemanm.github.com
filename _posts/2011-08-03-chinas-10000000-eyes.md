China installed [more than 10,000,000 surveillance cameras](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/02/china-surveillance-cameras) in 2010. Talk about a stream of "big data":

>In May, Shanghai announced that a team of 4,000 monitor its surveillance feeds to ensure round-the-clock coverage. The south-western municipality of Chongqing has announced plans to add 200,000 cameras by 2014 because "310,000 digital eyes are not enough".

>Urumqi, which saw vicious ethnic violence in 2009, installed 17,000 high-definition, riot-proof cameras last year to ensure "seamless" surveillance. Fast-developing Inner Mongolia plans to have 400,000 units by 2012. In the city of Changsha, the Furong district alone reportedly has 40,000 â€“ one for every 10 inhabitants.
