I just got back from a trip up to the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville for the every-three-month scans cycle. MRI and CT scans clear with only a couple minor things to monitor. These weekends are always a bit of a mental "reset", and a relief to be done with. Laying in a tube for 90 minutes is never fun, but I've done it enough times now that it's sorta routine. Being proactive about monitoring change is more important than a little discomfort for a couple hours.

Now it's off my mind til September.
