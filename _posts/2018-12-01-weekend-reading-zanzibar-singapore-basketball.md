### 🇹🇿 [Exploring Zanzibar with Mapillary](https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2018/11/22/exploring-zanzibar-part-1.html)

A fun travel post from the Mapillary team after [FOSS4G](https://2018.foss4g.org/) in Dar es Salaam. A drive around Zanzibar collecting images for OpenStreetMap mapping. Also check out [part 2](https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2018/11/28/exploring-zanzibar-part-2.html) of the journey.

### 🇸🇬 [City of the Future: Singapore])(https://youtu.be/xi6r3hZe5Tg)

Singapore is an interesting experiment: a benevolent authoritarian government, small population, and limited geography to leverage and nurture. This documentary is a bit of a commercial for their plans for the future. Still some fun ideas that (if successful) other megacities could use to maintain quality of life with population growth.

### 🏀 [How to Watch Basketball](https://cleaningtheglass.com/how-to-watch-basketball/)

This was a great explainer. I've only been seriously watching basketball a couple of years, and I was starting to figure out some of these techniques myself. It's interesting to see how coaches and professional analysts approach watching a game.
