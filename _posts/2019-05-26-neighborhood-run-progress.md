I'm making quick work of the [streets of Shore Acres]({{ site.url }}/post/run-shore-acres/ "Run Shore Acres"). Yesterday I set up a quick and dirty local database that I could load the tracks into. I'm just using the GPX export feature on each activity and the `ogr2ogr` command line utility to import each one.

{% include image.html file="run-shore-acres-progress.jpg" description="Run Shore Acres progress" caption="no" %}

Now I can see the streets get painted as I complete the job.

I ran a quick calculation on the street centerline data to estimate the total distance of roadway and counted about 37 miles. Once I'm done with each section I'll tabulate how much total running it took to cover all the combined distances.
