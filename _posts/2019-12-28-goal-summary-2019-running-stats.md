Continuing my summaries from a couple weeks ago, this post covers some statistics on running throughout 2019.

I track all of my runs with a Garmin fenix 5 watch synced to Strava, but also have been logging each one to a spreadsheet as I complete them. That way I've got an easy dataset to work with for analyzing and charting the results.

Here's the overall breakdown of stats for the year:

| **Stat**             | Total                |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Total Distance**   | 615.55 miles         |
| **Total Duration**   | 86 hours, 32 minutes |
| **Total Activities** | 148                  |
| **Average Distance** | 4.16 miles           |
| **Average Pace**     | 8:26 minute/mile     |
| **Total Calories**   | 66,431 cal           |
| **Best Month**       | September (88 miles) |
| **Worst Month**      | March (39.6 miles)   |

September was my big training month for the October [half marathon](/post/13-point-1/ "13.1") (August was decent too, at about 70 miles).

2019 was my best running year by a wide margin. I got the fitness up to the point where 5-6 milers are pretty easy (when pacing), and the half proved that I can go even farther with a little preparation.

I've got new marks I'll be aiming for in 2020, but probably won't have time to post about the plan until into January a bit. Next up will be the map showing the year's running coverage.
