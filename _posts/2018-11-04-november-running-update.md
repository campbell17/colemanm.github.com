After a tumultuous 8-10 months since last summer, I’ve gotten regularly back into running the last few months. I did over 50K in distance during August. I haven’t checked, but that must be a personal record. There were 2 weeks in a row with 3 10K runs a piece in there. Running late in the evening has turned out to be good for multiple reasons; I can always guarantee the freedom on the schedule and the weather is more manageable at 10pm in August and September.

But I think all those long runs in that spell screwed up my right knee. None of those runs that month felt _bad_ — in fact quite the opposite. Each one felt great, during and after. But a week or so later I had a really uncomfortable morning run, only a few miles and every bit past the first felt terrible. Fatigue in the calves and ankles, higher-than-normal heart rate. I think a combination of overwork, dehydration, and poor warm up combined to mess me up. The next several activities felt better, but the knee pain would be noticeable each time — not so much _during_ activities, but the next morning.

On the advice of [Caleb](https://twitter.com/cfsanderson "Caleb Sanderson"), I bought a wobble board and a foam roller to do better with my post-workout routine. The foam roller to avoid fascia injury and loosen muscle fibers, and the board to work on ankle and knee stability. I’ve only been using them for a week, but we’ll see how that cool down activity helps the joints feel better.

The last 3 weeks or so have been busy, with the [All Hands]({{ site.url }}/post/all-hands-2018/ "Fall All Hands 2018") week, tons of personal family events, and other various things. I’m hoping to get back on a consistent pace through the rest of the year as the weather gets much more tenable and enjoyable.
