# Canvas podcast series on Workflow
If you’re a podcast listener and an iOS user of productivity apps, you should subscribe to the [Canvas](https://www.relay.fm/canvas) podcast. Hosted by Federico Vittici (of [MacStories](http://www.macstories.net/)) and Fraser Spiers, these guys know all there is about making the iPad into a tool for getting real work done.

They’ve been doing a series on [Workflow](https://workflow.is/), the powerful app for iOS task automation. I love this app and use it a ton for a few simple, yet repetitive everyday tasks from my phone.

* [The Basics](https://www.relay.fm/canvas/22)
* [Variables and Built-In Actions](https://www.relay.fm/canvas/23)
* [Third Party Applications](https://www.relay.fm/canvas/24)

Hopefully they continue the series with additional stuff on how they're using Workflow to tie together processes for iPad-based work.
