P.J. O'Rourke [on his time in Afghanistan](http://www.weeklystandard.com/print/articles/72-hour-expert):

>"Traditionalism being one of the things that makes Afghanistan so hard for Americans to understand. We Americans have so many traditions. For instance our political traditions date back to the 12th-century English Parliament if not to the Roman Senate. Afghans, on the other hand, have had the representative democracy kind of politics for only six years. Afghanistan’s political traditions are just beginning to develop. A Pashtun tribal leader told me that a 'problem among Afghan politicians is that they do not tell the truth.' It’s a political system so new that that needed to be said out loud."
