We closed today on our new house. It's only about 10 minutes away from where we live now, but a nicer neighborhood, more space, a larger garage, closer to parks, with better school access for the kids. We're excited about finally making this jump after talking about it for 4+ years. We've always liked where we live currently, the location and the house, but we've outgrown it with two little people now here. There's been no packing or moving yet; we're on our way to Jacksonville tomorrow for medical follow-up stuff. So all the fun moving will have to wait til we get back.

It'll be nice to have a fresh start!
