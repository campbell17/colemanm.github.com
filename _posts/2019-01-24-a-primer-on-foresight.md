The last several months I've been spending quite a bit of time working on this: our geospatial data and analytical product line called [Foresight](https://spatialnetworks.com/foresight/). We've been in this business dating back to 2000 in various forms and using the technologies of the era, but empowered by [today's technology](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/), decision support tools, and the open source geo stack, it's evolved to something novel and unmatched for our customers.

At its core it's "data-as-a-service" designed to give customers the insights they need to do more, spend less, decide faster, and reduce their uncertainty, with a focus on international geospatial markets.

As Tony put it succinctly in his post, which sums it up nicely:

> The ability to _know before you go_ or even, in some cases, eliminate the need to go at all is a unique hallmark to our Foresight products.

We're working on some example products right now that'll tell a concrete, compelling story about how Foresight works in practice. I'll be interested to share more about that down the road once we get them out there.
