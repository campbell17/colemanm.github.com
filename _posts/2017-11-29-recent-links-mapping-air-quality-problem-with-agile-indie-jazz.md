### ⏱ [Mapping Street-Level Air Quality in California](https://blog.google/products/maps/getting-hyper-local-mapping-street-level-air-quality-across-california/)

This is amazing work by Google putting air quality sensors on their Street View cars to collect air quality data. The resolution of this is amazing — to see how drastically the pollutant level changes from street to street.

I love Ryan Singer’s perspective on product development. In this post he levels critique at the now-commonplace “agile” software development process. It’s been distorted into a simplistic set of tactical process methods (building in “cycles”), and has lost what its original value was as an upgrade from the old school “waterfall” approach.

> Agile became synonymous with speed. Everybody wants more, faster. And one thing most teams aren’t doing fast enough is shipping. So cycles became “sprints” and the metric of success, “velocity.”

> But speed isn’t the problem. And cycles alone don’t help you ship. The problems are doing the wrong things, building to specs, and getting distracted.

### 🎷 [The Best Jazz on Bandcamp: October 2017](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/11/10/the-best-jazz-on-bandcamp-october-2017/)

Bandcamp’s blog is one of my favorite places to find new music these days. They do an excellent job surfacing the interesting things from the community and featuring them like this. Must be some real music nerds over there; just browse their blog post titles and see what I mean.
