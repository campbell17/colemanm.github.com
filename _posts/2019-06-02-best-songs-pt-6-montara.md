The title track from vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson's 1975 album *[Montara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montara_(album) "Montara")*. I love the gentle electric piano, muted horns, and of course Bobby's vibes.

Madlib also sampled this one on his album *[Shades of Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_Blue_(Madlib_album) "Shades of Blue")*, which remixed tons of the great hits from the Blue Note catalog.
