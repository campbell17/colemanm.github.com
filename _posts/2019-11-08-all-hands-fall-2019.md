We just wrapped up our Fall “all hands” week at the office. Another good week to see everyone from out of town, and an uncommonly productive one at that. We got a good amount of planning discussion done for future product roadmap additions, did some testing on new stuff in the lab, fixed some bugs, shared some knowledge, and ate (a lot). 

Looking forward to the next one!
