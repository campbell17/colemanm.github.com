title: "Thoughts on Teaching"

I'm fascinated by learning. Effective learning relies on curiosity — a highly-valued characteristic of all people who grow emotionally and intellectually over time. _Teaching_, on the other hand, is the steering of the learning process. The best sort of teaching is when a teacher lays down the breadcrumb trail, explains some fundamentals for context, and does their best to let the student discover the path. But we don't teach children the value of curiosity; we skip that part and jump to information transfer. There's little opportunity for this discovery to happen, removing the satisfaction of dot-connecting as you understand something new. The ability to synthesize information for yourself from discrete parts leads to true understanding. Memorizing division tables or the works of Shakespeare doesn't create that sense of wonder that comes with deep comprehension.

With my daughter now 15 months old, I'm doing a lot of thinking and observing about how kids learn, and how we teach. It's amazing to watch her discover something new on her own. One day we watched her figure out that magnets stick to the refrigerator. We'd then watch her try to stick all sorts of things to the fridge after that — her own gradual trial-and-error process. And it was great to see the sense of gratification in her eyes when she discovered that the whiteboard in her room was also magnetic, seeing her move things between her room and the kitchen. I believe this sort of discovery-based learning is the most meaningful and long-lasting, and we should be striving to set up conducive environments in schools.

A contentious topic around learning concerns _what_ is being taught. There's value in being selective about what we teach to children, to be sure — there are only so many hours in the day after all. I'm of the opinion that the _"how"_ of teaching is far more important. Attempts at bringing up collective grades in US primary schools mostly center around tactical changes to the process — common core, standardized testing, FCAT — a long list of mechanical box-checking leading us to believe a student has learned all they need to know. If we spent half as much energy on creating better spaces for discovery as we do on measuring performance, we'd have incredibly smarter children. I think some strategic questioning on the paradigms of the system itself is in order.

Of course, a key factor creating the system we have now is the desire for total equality in results. Our structures are focused heavily around fairness that it requires us to have rigid measurement regimes to constantly gut-check the system. There's little room for individualism, for children to have the room to gravitate toward things they show proclivities for. We expend so much energy on trying to pull everyone up to a minimum standard in a comprehensive set of "subjects" we've collectively deemed worthy of all our childrens' attention: math, science, reading, art. Granted, these things all have their inherent values, but it's a stretch to say that the world and their future _require_ them to know about Robert Frost poems or that reptiles are cold-blooded. They're required to reach a baseline in a spread of subjects because we've built a construct that tests them against this, preventing upward motion until they reach the "quota". A self-fulfilling prophecy. This relentless assumption that we can produce high school graduates with an equal knowledge level is absurd, and even with the systems we have in place, we _think_ they're reaching high school with equal measures of comprehension, and it's patently not true in reality, even if it is on paper.

I find it helpful to peel back a process to its core objectives. What is the mission of K-12 education? To produce a bunch of equal adults? Because it doesn't happen that way even now, and thinking anything else is pretending. I think the goal of education is to teach children _how to learn_, as a foundation, and give them the tools to be self-sufficient in absorbing, understanding, and harnessing new information.

Making learning a rewarding experience
Severe lack of individual reward
Hands-on skills

Years ago I read Sal Khan's "One World Schoolhouse". He founded [The Khan Academy]() in 2006 as an attempt to bring
A favorite segment was on the origins of our public school system structure, military academies
Arbitrary grouping of students by age

What _is_ the best approach to creating productive individuals?
The goal of education systems is to prepare youth for a diverse set of potential futures
Lowest-common denominator approach
Your position in the real world is a lot more specialized than the education you receive through age 18 (and sometimes even further out in state colleges, and most majors)
What's wrong with specializing the approach from the get-go?
Improve the strengths rather than dragging forward the weaknesses
Analogy to product development
Effective and useful products require focus, and focus by definition means you _aren't even shooting_ at many potential targets
What if we used a similar approach in schools
It is worthwhile to retain some amount of baseline exposure to various topics - math, reading, writing, science, humanities
But rather than zeroing in so closely on each and _forcing_ every student to achieve total comprehension on everything, why not lower the baseline and _raise_ targets on areas where students show strong aptitude in grade school?
Of course, the biggest problem most people have with the architecture of public education has to do with measurement / grading / scoring, which seems to be unfortunately focused on everything but the students.
It feels like an education system that assumes it's the only place for a child to learn is destined to be a broken one.
A better approach might be to assume the opposite — that kids are soaking things up all waking hours. You don't have to shove home 2 hours of homework each night in order for a 2nd grader to learn for more than 6 hours in a day. She should be learning _other_ valuable things about the world during a Tuesday evening. But the school isn't in control, and I think therein lies the issue. Bureaucratic structures gravitate toward removal of personal responsibility.


The Khan Academy's goal is to deconstruct our preconceived notions about how we teach and how kids learn
