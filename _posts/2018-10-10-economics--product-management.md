A continuous challenge in product development (perhaps _the ultimate_ challenge) is the balancing of many wants and needs with an inability to have everything. You never have the resources to build everything you want into your product — be it labor, capital, or time.

All this year I’ve been studying economics, some foundational resources, different philosophies, and the history of economic theories. I think what attracts me to the subject is how its fundamentals can be applied to so many other areas. I just finished Thomas Sowell’s “_[Basic Economics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3023.Basic_Economics)_” a few weeks ago, which is a great plain-English primer on many foundational principles. At the core, economics seeks to understand how value is created and exchanged — how forces within systems interplay with one another. Sowell defines economics as the “study of the use of scarce resource which have alternative uses.”

Managing resources to build something is a great example of scarcity at work. Trade-offs are a fact of life, and the entire job of product management is balancing the right trade-offs to achieve the desired goal. It may seem obvious, but it’s amazing how often people lose the plot and don’t respect the reality or limitations. The [project management triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle) also comes to mind here. I find frequent reminders of these constraints helpful to ground my efforts in a frame of achievable reality, while maintaining the ability to set and meet expectations.
