I’ve been collecting paper maps for years. It’s one of the few collection habits I’ve allowed myself to keep (well, including books). Some time back I wanted to inventory all of them. So I built an app in Fulcrum to log the title, source, publishing date, and photos of each.

My collection’s up to 210 now. I’m working on a way to publish this. The other similar app I built a while back is a “map of maps”, basically a similar structure to my collection, but actually geotagging out in the world where I run across maps — park signage, street areas, outdoor mall floor plans, transit maps, and the like. I should set up a [Fulcrum Community](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/community "Fulcrum Community") project to share out for folks to help build the ultimate map of public maps.
