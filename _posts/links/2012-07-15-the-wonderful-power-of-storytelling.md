[Bruce Sterling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling) on storytelling and the art of computer game design, [from GDC 1991](http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/comp_game_designers.article):

> I don't think you can last by meeting the contemporary public taste, the taste from the last quarterly report. I don't think you can last by following demographics and carefully meeting expectations. I don't know many works of art that last that are condescending. I don't know many works of art that last that are deliberately stupid. You may be a geek, you may have geek written all over you; you should aim to be one geek they'll never forget. Don't aim to be civilized. Don't hope that straight people will keep you on as some kind of pet. To hell with them; they put you here. You should fully realize what society has made of you and take a terrible revenge. Get weird. Get way weird. Get dangerously weird. Get sophisticatedly, thoroughly weird and don't do it halfway, put every ounce of horsepower you have behind it.

Don't stick to tradition, and don't go halfway.

I Instapaper'd this over a year ago and ran across it while reading some old stuff.
