If you're a nerd about checking your download and upload bandwidth when things seem to be getting slow, you've certainly used [Speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net/) to find out your raw internet speed. If you're an even bigger nerd, you'll love this command line tool for running quick tests from the shell. The Speedtest website is so covered with nonsense these days, I wonder how much of my bandwidth is being taken to display Flash ads and run Javascript trackers.

It's not a 100% accurate tool, but it gets me what I need.
