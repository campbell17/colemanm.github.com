An entertaining talk from [Rich Hickey](https://twitter.com/richhickey), creator of the Clojure programming language. He talks about the value of simplicity in software design, and spends a decent amount of time refining the semantic differences between "simple" and "easy". My biggest takeaway: simple is _objective_, easy is _relative_.

It gets pretty technical in the CS realm, but good principles for building anything.
