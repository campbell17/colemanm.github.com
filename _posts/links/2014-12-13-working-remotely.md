Great post from [Tim](https://twitter.com/timcampbell17) on our recent all-hands sprint at our [new office](http://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/open-for-business-in-downtown-st-pete/).

I've seen our company transform itself from all on-site to very distributed inside of 5 years. An interesting evolution, finally clicking after some initial false starts. Growing with a dispersed team is a challenge to say the least, in finding the right patterns for communication and striking a balance of face-to-face interaction with teleworking. Getting it right allows us to grow our team with the _right_ people, instead of arbitrarily restricting us to _close_ people.
