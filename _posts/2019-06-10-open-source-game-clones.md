I don’t play games at all anymore these days, but I ran across this repository of open source clones of classic PC games.

Some notable ones from the list that we used to play:

- [0 AD](https://play0ad.com/) — Age of Empires
- [C-Evo](http://www.c-evo.org/) — Civilization II
- [Interstate Outlaws](http://www.interstateoutlaws.com/) — Interstate ‘76
- [Jedi Outcast Linux](https://github.com/xLAva/JediOutcastLinux) — Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast
- [OpenRCT](https://openrct2.org/) — Rollercoaster Tycoon
- [OpenSkyscraper](http://openskyscraper.org/) — SimTower

The world of open source software (and GitHub, specifically) really is amazing. Kids out there the age I was when I played these can now go online and look at the source code to see how they're made.
