There are several excellent renditions of this tribute to the late trumpeter [Clifford Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Brown), originally composed by saxophonist Benny Golson (well known for his time with the Jazz Messengers).

My favorite version is this live cut from Freddie Hubbard, 1984. Captures the soul of the original perfectly, on stage and with little accompaniment.
