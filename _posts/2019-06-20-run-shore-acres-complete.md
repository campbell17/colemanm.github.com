Earlier this week I finished up [my personal challenge]({{ site.url }}/post/run-shore-acres/ "Run Shore Acres") to run all of the street segments in my neighborhood, Shore Acres.

{% include image.html file="run-shore-acres-complete.jpg" description="Completed Shore Acres" caption="no" %}

Here's the breakdown of stats to get there:

- Total distance: **125 miles** â€” by my rough calculation there are about 39 miles of streets in Shore Acres, but it takes significant overlap running over past ground from my house to hit new streets
- Total activities: **36**
- Average run: **3.5 miles**
- Longest run: **5.2 miles**
- Started: **March 22, 2019**
- Finished: **June 20, 2019**

This was a fun challenge and added extra motivation for me to keep getting out there consistently. As I talked about in my [post on habits]({{ site.url }}/post/forming-habits/ "Forming Habits"), any form of personal challenge or goal-setting (even if manufactured) that forces you to get it done is a good one.

Now that this is complete, I'm planning to move on to [Snell Isle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell_Isle "Snell Isle") to the south. Why not keep painting the streets with GPS tracks?
