In September the training push continued for the half marathon. I did a personal record 88 miles in the 30 days, for an average of just about 3 miles per day the whole month. Somehow I'm not dead yet, but the aches and pains were there to prove it.

| Activity       | Progress     | Pace         | Goal         | Plus-Minus                        |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 460.88 miles | 373.97 miles | 500 miles    | <span class="green">+86.86</span> |
| **Meditation** | 2893 minutes | 2730 minutes | 3650 minutes | <span class="green">+163</span>   |
| **Reading**    | 42 books     | 33.66 books  | 50 books     | <span class="green">+8.34</span>  |

I think I've got the joint, knee, and foot pains to a manageable stage and seem to be turning the corner on that. My post-workout stretching process has been more diligent, shoes improved things, pacing, and proper rest days inserted in there. I'm really looking forward to the weather playing nicely in October and getting the temperatures down, at least a little.

The best books this month were for sure the two short story collections I read: Ted Chiang's _[Exhalation](/books/chiang-exhalation/ "Exhalation")_ and Ken Liu's _[The Paper Menagerie](/books/liu-the-paper-menagerie-and-other-stories/ "The Paper Menagerie")_. Both of them phenomenal blends of fantasy, speculative fiction, and historical science fiction, with imaginitive and thought-provoking short stories and novellas I'm still thinking about.

We're moving into the final quarter of the year going strong on all of the [goals](/post/2019/ "2019 Goals"). By the end of the month I'll be able to report back on my experiences with the first 13.1 mile race of my running career.
