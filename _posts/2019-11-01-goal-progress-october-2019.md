The big achievement this month was the culmination of the half marathon training, ending October by finishing my first one.

| Activity       | Progress     | Pace         | Goal         | Plus-Minus                         |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 520.12 miles | 416.44 miles | 500 miles    | <span class="green">+103.68</span> |
| **Meditation** | 3208 minutes | 3040 minutes | 3650 minutes | <span class="green">+168</span>    |
| **Reading**    | 47 books     | 37.48 books  | 50 books     | <span class="green">+9.52</span>   |

The other notable movement was surpassing the 500 mile goal, which happened on this run and I didn’t even realize it at the time. I was able to knock out the mileage goal 2 1/2 months early. Back in March I definitely didn’t expect to be much over the target at all, let alone a full 100 miles beyond the pace mark. At this rate I’m pretty confident in hitting the 600 mile mark, especially with the nicer weather around the corner. I might do one more race in December, likely only a 10 or 15K.

This month I finally finished _[The Federalist](/books/hamilton-the-federalist-papers/ "The Federalist")_, which I’d put down for a while. I made extensive notes throughout it. I’m looking forward to flipping back through for a refresher soon. Such a phenomenal work to put together such a deep, thoughtful, still-relevant rationale for strong but limited governance.

The other read this month that definitely made my “best of” list for the year was Tracy Kidder’s _[The Soul of a New Machine](/books/kidder-the-soul-of-a-new-machine/ "The Soul of a New Machine")_. A riveting story of a small team developing an early minicomputer. This story had to be one of the inspirations for _[Halt and Catch Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(TV_series) "Halt and Catch Fire")_, turning rooms full of geeks into a fast-paced drama.
