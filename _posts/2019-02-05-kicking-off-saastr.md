Today was day 1 of the 3-day SaaStr Annual, my third one. Each year they up their game in terms of size and session quality. Logistics are much improved at the larger San Jose Convention Center. The team at SaaStr did an excellent job improving on the shortcomings of past years while still expanding in attendance quite a bit.

I did sessions today from Tom Tunguz from Redpoint, Ryan Smith of Qualtrics, and a great back-and-forth discussion with Jeff Lawson (Twilio) and Anil Dash (Glitch).
