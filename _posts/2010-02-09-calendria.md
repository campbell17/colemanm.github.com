Calendria is a place where units of time become sovereignties.

>"The Kingdom of March, with the Equinoctial Estuary on its western coast, is situated on a separate land mass to the east of Calendriaâ€™s main continent.  The Republic of Junistan is in the southeast, an archipelago among which are the Circadian Islands."
