Paul Romer has an interesting take on [this piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/) from the Atlantic:

> Jupyter rewards transparency; Mathematica rationalizes secrecy. Jupyter encourages individual integrity; Mathematica lets individuals hide behind corporate evasion. Jupyter exemplifies the social systems that emerged from the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, systems that make it possible for people to cooperate by committing to objective truth; Mathematica exemplifies the horde of new Vandals whose pursuit of private gain threatens a far greater public lossâ€“the collapse of social systems that took centuries to build.

The original article is a great read, touching on the work of those like Steven Strogatz and Bret Victor to use more plain-language narrative to communicate complex mathematical ideas. Just as the GitHub has become "the commons" for software and a bottomless resource for learning programming, Jupyter notebooks are taking over the world of data science and research publication.
