Another hectic (but fun-filled) Christmas in the books — 3 Christmases in 3 locations. We just got home from the marathon 18-hour day of family visiting, eating, and gift-opening. This time around Everett is _super_ into unwrapping, so it was hard to keep him away from the piles before we were getting started. Both kids made out like bandits. Now we just have to create some space for all the new goodies.
