I first saw this through Google's [Earth View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/earth-view-from-google-ea/bhloflhklmhfpedakmangadcdofhnnoh "Earth View") a few months back. It's a coastal area of the Kimberly Region in Western Australia.

Bands of low-lying mountain ranges run from southeast to northwest, jutting out into the Timor Sea. The striated bands of folded rock formations create low-elevation channels, and where these meet the ocean you get fjord-like features slicing into the coastline. It reminds me of [The Vale](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Vale_of_Arryn "The Vale") from the map of Westeros.

Along the coast you get features like the [Horizontal Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_Falls "Horizontal Falls"): a bottleneck at the mouth of a creek where creek outflows and high tidal waters back up, and when the tide falls rapidly, the onrush of draining water can't get out fast enough.

It's a beautiful shot of a wild and remote part of northwestern Australia.
