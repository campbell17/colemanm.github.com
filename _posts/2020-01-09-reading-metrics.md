Since I began tracking my books [in a spreadsheet](/post/the-library-database/ "The Library Database") in 2018, I've got a bunch of data I can now look at on my reading habits.

One thing I took a stab at was a "duration chart" that could show the reading patterns over time, based on when I started and finished each book.

{% include image.html file="book-durations-2019.jpg" description="Book reading durations" caption="no" %}

Using this stacked bar chart style, you can see which books I stalled out on and put down for long periods. Not a judgment on those books' respective merits, more of a criticism of my dodgy reading habits. _[The Federalist](/books/hamilton-the-federalist-papers/ "The Federalist Papers")_ had probably a full 6 month fallow period where I forgot about it.

Some other fun-but-meaningless statistics:

### Total Pages

18,983[^pages]

### Type

* Fiction: 24%
* Nonfiction 76%

### Formats

* Audiobook: 57%
* Kindle: 13%
* Real Book: 30%

### Authors I read more than one from

* Nassim Taleb
* Cixin Liu
* HP Lovecraft
* Jonathan Haidt

### Oldest book

* Epictetus's _[Discourses](/books/epictetus-discourses/ "Discourses")_, written 108 AD

### Top 5 genres (from tags)

1. History
2. Philosophy
3. Psychology
4. Science
5. Business

[^pages]: Page counts are, of course, a very rough estimate. But fun to see the quantity and calculate pages per day on average (about 50!).
