  title: "Fermat's Library"

This group is building some interesting tools to expose and enable sharing and collaboration on academic papers. 

> We develop software to help illuminate academic papers. Just as Pierre de Fermat scribbled his famous last theorem in the margins, professional scientists, academics and citizen scientists can annotate equations, figures, ideas and write in the margins.

They have a tool called [Margins](https://fermatslibrary.com/margins "Margins"), which allows researchers to upload, annotate, and share academic papers, and another neat one called [Librarian](https://fermatslibrary.com/librarian "Librarian"), a Chrome extension for comments and annotations for [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/ "arXiv") papers.

FL also has an [awesome Twitter account](https://twitter.com/fermatslibrary "Fermat's Library") that's worth following.
