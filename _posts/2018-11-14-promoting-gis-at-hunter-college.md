As premier sponsors of the American Geographical Society, we try to do our part in promoting geographic literacy, education, and the future of geo sciences.

Part of our efforts this week is participating in the [GIS Career Fair](http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/news/gis_job_fair_2018.html "2nd Annual GIS Career Fair") at Hunter College in Manhattan. Bill and I were there to showcase how geography fits into our business and talking with students about what it means to build a career centered around GIS and mapping. We talked to dozens of people about all aspects of the industry, with a diverse group interested in environmental science, energy, space, and more.

It’s good to see the energy and excitement in the geospatial industry.
