Bloomberg has been publishing this video series on future technologies called "[Giant Leap](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BloombergGiantLeap "Bloomberg Giant Leap")." It's well-done and a nice use of YouTube as a medium.

This one explores a number of new companies doing R&D in microgravity manufacturing — from biological [organ "printing"](https://techshot.com/bioprinter/ "BioPrinter") to creation of high-quality [fiber optic materials](https://madeinspace.us/capabilities-and-technology/fiber-optics/ "ZBLAN"). There are still some challenges ahead to unlock growth of space as a manufacturing environment, but it feels like we're on the cusp of a new platform for industrial growth in the near future.
