### ‚ö°Ô∏è [The US Wind Turbine Database](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/viewer/#3/37.25/-96.25 "US Wind Turbine Database")

Ben Hoen from the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab gave a lightning talk at Geo2050 about this project, a map and database of the operational wind generation capacity in the US. The map currently reports the country producing around 90 gigawatts of wind power. They also publish the [raw dataset](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/data/ "USWTDB data") for download.

### üß¨ [Interview with Bruce Sterling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0__x5SG8WY "Interview with Bruce Sterling")

One of my favorite science fiction authors. Talks about his work, industrial design, speculative architecture, and risk models.

### üíµ [The Clash of Economic Ideas](https://ppe.mercatus.org/podcast/2012/05/31/lawrence-white-podcast-econtalk-clash-economic-ideas "Russ Roberts from EconTalk")

Russ Roberts (of [EconTalk](http://www.econtalk.org/ "EconTalk")) and Lawrence White discuss economists of the last hundred years and the variances in their ideas.
