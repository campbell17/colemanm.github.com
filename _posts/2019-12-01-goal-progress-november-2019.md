This was a busy one. Between the All Hands earlier in the month and the week off for the holidays, those are brutal to maintaining the routine (though great to get a break and spend time with both workmates and family, respectively).

Here are the stats with one month left to go:

| Activity       | Progress     | Pace         | Goal         | Plus-Minus                         |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| **Running**    | 574.02 miles | 457.53 miles | 500 miles    | <span class="green">+120.53</span> |
| **Meditation** | 3503 minutes | 3340 minutes | 3650 minutes | <span class="green">+163</span>    |
| **Reading**    | 51 books     | 45.75 books  | 50 books     | <span class="green">+5.25</span>   |

Once I hit the 600 mile mark on the running in the next couple of weeks, I’m planning on taking the rest of the year off to see if I can rehab the foot and ankle pain that’s built up. I’m past the goal line now on a couple of these, which feels good.
