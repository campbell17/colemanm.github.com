I enjoyed the backgrounds in quantum mechanics and relativity more than the primary topic of the book: string theory. String theory is certainly fascinating as a potential "theory of everything", but it's hard to assemble a primer on the subject for those of us that aren't theoretical physicists. It gets wild and abstract pretty quick.
