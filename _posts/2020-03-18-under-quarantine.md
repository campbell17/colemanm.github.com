It's a weird time right now across the globe. People all over are quarantined, either because of government mandate or self-isolation from others to try and stop the spread of the coronavirus.

I don't think the world needs more sideline expertise or prognostication about what the virus is doing, how this period will end, or how the economy recovers. There's already plenty of that out online and in the media â€” probably way too much.

But I wanted to write something down about this as a personal note for future me to read in the archives.

We're on day 5 of a self-imposed quarantine, with the family here at home limiting our time out and about, and me working from the house. We've been out to the store a couple of times, but mostly we're spending time here, in the backyard pool, or doing bike rides around the block. All things considered, it hasn't been too bad. Work is different, but the whole team being remote hasn't changed that much in productivity levels that I can tell yet.

There doesn't seem to be a turnaround point hit yet in the rate of new infections. We'll probably be holed up another few weeks, minimum.

We're still sane so far, but we'll see what 2 or 3 more weeks alone in the house with kids does to us.
