I'm headed out to San Jose, CA next week for the [SaaStr Annual](https://www.saastrannual.com/ "SaaStr Annual") conference. It'll be my third in a row; definitely one of the events I most look forward to nowadays. It always brings a great combo of interesting content, energy, diverse attendees, and fun side events to enjoy.

I wrote up this preview of sessions I'm looking forward to this time around. They do a great job touching on some of the same things year over year (helpful for tracking industry trends) but also mixing in plenty of new voices each time around.
