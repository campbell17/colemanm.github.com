Today starts the annual family vacation, this year over in the Disney area south of Orlando. To a Floridian the destination isn't terribly exciting, but we wanted to keep it simple this year. 3 of the cousins are 6 months or younger, so any trip involving lots of on-the-go activity or air travel becomes challenging.

There aren't any big plans other than relaxing at the house, swimming (yep, in December), and maybe a couple of trips to theme parks with the kids.
