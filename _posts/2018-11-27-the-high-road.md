A great reminder for those of us that can get spun up and anxious about the unimportant, from Shane Parrish:

> When people are rude, our subconscious interprets it as an assault on hierarchy instincts. Our evolutionary programming responds with thoughts like, “Who are you to tell me something so rude? I’ll show you….”
>
> Our instincts are to escalate when really, we should be focused on de-escalating the situation. One way to do that is to take the high road.
>
> Say something along the lines of “I can see that.” You don’t have to apologize. You don’t have to agree with what the other person is saying. But I promise the results are magic. It’s hard to be angry with someone who agrees with you. And when there is no one to argue with and they’re the only person worked up about the situation, they will quickly feel uncomfortable and try to correct course.
