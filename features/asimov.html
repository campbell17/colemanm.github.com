<h1>Asimov Reads</h1>

<div class="feature"</div>
This is a collection of essays about Isaac Asimov's science fiction universe, following my reading of his work. These posts follow the meta-story of his few series. I've opted to read them in <a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/2335/what-order-should-asimovs-foundation-series-be-read-in">chronological order</a>, rather than order of original publishing.

<table cellspacing="0" class="archive-table">
  {% for post in site.categories.asimov reversed %}
  <tr class="{% cycle 'even', 'odd' %}">
    <td><a href='{{post.url}}'>{{post.title}}</a></td>
    <td class="right-cell"><em>{{post.book}}</em>, {{post.publish_date}}</td>
  </tr>
  {% endfor %}
</table>
